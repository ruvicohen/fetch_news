Smells Like A False Flag...", "body": "Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey.\n\nThe term \"False Flag\" gets thrown around rather haphazardly these days and it's important to recognize that a real false flag requires a particular end result - The public blaming the wrong culprit for an event that someone else (usually our own government) perpetrated. When it comes to the increasing fervor over major drone activity across the US, I have very little doubt that what we are witnessing is a false flag scenario.\n\nFirst, let's outline what has happened so far: Drone sightings have exploded across the country involving a wide variety of devices - but the incidents that concern me the most are those involving the SUV-sized UAVs in places like New Jersey. The sightings have been happening for months. US government agencies including the FBI, DHS and national security officials claim they have no idea who is behind this activity, even though drones have been seen operating over highly protected areas like US military bases.\n\nThere's a lot of information to be gleaned here if you know what you're looking for. I have written extensively about drones and drone warfare in my survival newsletter over the years, primarily on new developments in the technology and ways for civilians to defeat that technology. However, I have also written on how civilians can use drones for their own self defense.\n\nI know enough about tracking technology to say with relative certainly that officials are lying about the drones over New Jersey, and probably about most of the covert drone activity in other parts of the country. They know who is controlling these drones, and it's most likely our own government. What we are witnessing is some form of false flag in progress.\n\nFirst and foremost, drones can indeed be tracked rather easily depending on where they fly. Remote signals going back to the operator can be tracked with the right equipment. The stronger the remote signal the easier it is to find the operator. In New Jersey, for example, US Air Force Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst partnered with AeroDefense, a local business specializing in tracking technology and drone detection, to produce a system to track drones across the installation as well as pinpoint perpetrators who fly them. They started this program back in 2020.\n\nDrone company DJI, which controls around 90% of the consumer drone market, has their own proprietary drone tracking technology that can be purchased by governments and various agencies. There's likely dozens more companies out there right now producing similar products to the DJI tracking tech.\n\nUnder new FAA regulations instituted this year, all drones operating in US air space (except very small drones) are required to carry a Remote ID module which broadcasts operator information and location. Most drones now have Remote ID integrated into their software and removing it can be a pain. For example, DJI drones are basically no longer used by Ukrainian forces because the built-in Remote ID gives away their positions. They now build most of their drones from scratch.\n\nThere are ways around drone tracking (to a point). Remote ID spoofing devices can be built and programmed for as little as $20. These broadcasting modules can create the illusion of dozens of drones in the sky with false operator data included. Anyone trying to use Remote ID tracking to find you will have no idea which drones are real and which are fake.\n\nDrone signal repeaters (which function much like ham radio repeaters) are not uncommon and are used in Ukraine by both sides to help confuse tracking attempts. Signal repeaters and antennas are easy to hide, and pinpointing an exact location is difficult. In Ukraine, trackers would simply find a general area where the antenna or operator might be and then hit it with artillery. If they only hit a repeater, then the operator is out about $200 and that's it.\n\nThe Russians use drones connected to long spools of fiber optic cable which allows them to send the devices into areas protecting by jamming. The direct connection also keeps the operators from being tracked.\n\nThen there are drones with AI software which bypass a lot of tracking tools. If the drone is controlling itself then there's no operator signal to trace. The drone might be broadcasting a video signal but that's not going to give up the location of the people who deployed the drone.\n\nMost of these techniques would never be used by common civilians or even small terror groups (AI flight software in particular would only be used by governments). On top of that, access to large drones or car-sized drones is very rare for civilians and requires extensive permits. The cost of such devices is prohibitive (tens-of-thousands or hundreds-of-thousands of dollars depending on the drone).\n\nMy point is, there is no way civilian operators or small terror groups are behind the majority of these events. The level of sophistication involved here requires military or government agency oversight. Beyond that, there aren't enough countermeasures in the world to prevent tracking over sensitive government locations. The US military and DHS have extensive means to track down drones (especially large drones) flying in close proximity to bases and protected sites.\n\nTriangulation would not be hard given the drone operators would have to fly through the middle of multiple detection equipped facilities. And, even if the drones are AI operated, large drones are not very fast or nimble. They could be followed without much trouble by helicopters or other drones.\n\nLack of public knowledge on this issue is being exploited by government officials and the media. I have seen multiple agency representatives claim that there's \"not enough restrictions in place\" to keep the threat of domestic drones in check. I have also seen government reps claim these drones are being operated by a foreign enemy like Iran. Recently, at least two men were arrested for flying a small drone too close to an airport in Chicago - Federal agencies and the media have tried to link these men to the covert drone sighting across the country when it's likely they have nothing to do with the situation.\n\nMisinformation like this suggests an attempt to pin the drone activity on civilian sources, or, a foreign adversary working with civilian sources. In other words, they are preparing the ground for one of two outcomes: More aggressive restrictions on civilian drones, or, an drone attack that is blamed on a foreign government.\n\nThe size of the drones is what worries me most. If the goal of a foreign government was to monitor sensitive sites and collect information, they wouldn't use car-sized drones. Large drones would be too easy to trace. They would use small mid-range drones outfitted with thermal that fit in a backpack.\n\nBut, our own government could fly fleets of large drones over cites and military bases with impunity. If our government wanted to, say, blow up a sacrificial military facility, damage a nuclear power plant or hit a civilian center, car-sized drones would be very useful because they are designed to carry considerable weight. Drones like those sighted over New Jersey could carry 500-1000 pounds of ordnance (maybe more). A swarm of these drones could cause total havoc in a heavily populated area.\n\nI worry about this outcome because the Biden Administration and the globalist establishment have been very active in the past several months trying to create as many ignition points for world war as they possibly can before Donald Trump takes office in January. A false flag at this time makes perfect sense.\n\nMy second theory is based on the strange comments by defense officials linking the activity to lack of restrictions on the civilian drone market. As noted, there is NO WAY civilians are flying car-sized drones in US airspace over protected sites without being followed. The drones are too expensive, too big to move around without people noticing and that kind of operation requires insider knowledge of DoD and DHS tracking methods.\n\nSome have speculated that there may be an agenda to get legislation (like a new Patriot Act) passed in the near future. I believe this may be a ploy to get traction on legislation restricting or banning civilian ownership of drones. Some people might be skeptical about that idea, but consider for a moment how useful drones are to a potential populist rebellion...\n\nFor over a century, governments and national armies have had a monopoly on aerial surveillance and the ability to engage enemies from the sky. With the invention of drones many patriots and survivalists have viewed the technology as the biggest threat to future attempts at rebellion against the establishment. The devices are cheap to produce, can operate in forests and urban environments and even small drones can carry enough explosives to maim or possibly kill with precision.\n\nIn the past, smaller forces using asymmetric tactics could still gain the upper hand against governments, even when fighting an advanced military with air superiority. Drones are now treated as the end game for insurgencies. But the truth is quite the opposite; drones are the end game for standard armies and a huge advantage for asymmetric rebellions. Drones are the biggest game changer in warfare for civilians since the invention of the repeating rifle.\n\nWe have seen the face of combat change dramatically in the war in Ukraine as drones become increasingly vital for both sides. Medium-sized drones have disrupted typical maneuver warfare tactics using high explosives to disable armored columns. Small drones allow operators to monitor the battlefield from the sky for miles and make discreet troop movements impossible.\n\nDrones can be easily used by civilians for the same purposes. For the first time ever, patriots have access to the air for surveillance and defense. I would not be surprised to see governments fabricate reasons why the technology \"needs to be banned\" - They will try to sell the American people on the idea that drones are a danger to public safety, even if that requires bankrolling a terror attack to frighten people into compliance.\n\nIn either case - A trigger for WWIII or a test case for banning the civilian drone market, the establishment gains an advantage. As far as I can tell, no one else benefits from these drone incidents. All signs point to a false flag. If this reality is exposed widely enough, I expect that the government will finally admit that they were behind the drone flights, but only as an effort to \"protect the public\" from an insidious threat that they could not tell us about beforehand.", "source": {"uri": "infowars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Infowars"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://imagedelivery.net/aeJ6ID7yrMczwy3WKNnwxg/ab587dcc-fee0-4264-6cac-a99552cad100/w=800,h=450", "eventUri": "eng-10172147", "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 92781, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "2024-12-577693303", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-16", "time": "19:40:36", "dateTime": "2024-12-16T19:40:36Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-16T19:39:51Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.infowars.com/posts/a-vexed-question", "title": "A Vexed Question", "body": "The who, what, where, why and how of demographic change are vexed questions. The who, in particular, and the why.\n\nFor some, like Renaud Camus, the man who actually coined the term \"the Great Replacement,\" mass demographic change in the West is not the product of any kind of conspiracy. There is no \"who\" as such directing the importation of hordes of Third World people into the nations of Europe, North America and the Anglosphere.\n\nInstead, for Camus, the Great Replacement is simply the result of the spread of a way of thinking he terms \"replaceism\": a belief that, ultimately, all people are just interchangeable and therefore there is no such thing as, say, genuine national or ethnic identity that should or even could be preserved.\n\nWe might call a variant of this the \"magic soil\" theory of identity. There is nothing, nothing apart from an official legal process, that can stop a Nigerian who lands in France or the UK from becoming French or British or Welsh or even, like me, Cornish.\n\nCamus sees \"replaceism\" as emerging and growing due to the profound social, economic and spiritual changes of the modern era -- everything from the Reformation and the Enlightenment to the spread of industrialisation, capitalism, mass democracy, mass education and mass entertainment.\n\nThe television is as much to blame as any politician.\n\nThe \"why\" that follows from this de-centered \"who\" is clearly also de-centered. \"Replaceism\" is the logic of the modern liberal world. It's unavoidable. There isn't any malice behind it. It has terrible effects, of course, and it's destroying the West, but the will behind it is blind and unfeeling.\n\nIt's not personal, however much you might hate it.\n\nMany people who criticize or f\u00eate Camus don't actually seem to know this: that he identifies no single group that is to blame, even if he holds politicians and the media in deep contempt -- as he, and we, should -- for their cowardice and self-serving behaviour. People who describe Camus as a racist or white supremacist or even right wing usually tend to ignore what he's actually saying.\n\nThe opposite tendency -- well, we know what that looks like, don't we? An identifiable group and a clear sense of malice towards the people of the West. Often, that group is said to be some tribe of wandering desert folk, like the Bedouin or the Bakhtiari nomads of Iran. These people, from a deep historical antipathy for settled agricultural peoples and in particular Christians, have decided to subvert and overthrow their societies and civilisation from within.\n\nThis account, by contrast, is very personal.\n\nEverywhere we look, at all the institutions that are bringing on the Great Replacement -- from the government departments and the think-tanks to the religious NGOs bussing migrants and the universities indoctrinating Westerners to hate themselves, their culture and their history, not to mention the companies sapping the younger generation's desire to reproduce with porn, dating apps and parasocial smut websites like OnlyFans -- everywhere we look we detect the sandy fingers and the mint-yoghurt smell of a Bedouin or some such. Or so the theory goes.\n\nThe implication, of course, is that any attempt to reverse mass immigration and mass demographic change must therefore focus on this group primarily, on dislodging them from their secret control of the West.\n\nThe truth, I think, is somewhere in between. We absolutely must reckon with enormous impersonal changes that have taken place and made it possible to think a Nigerian can become a Briton simply on the basis of a citizenship test. The way we think about nationality and identity has changed tremendously, and it has changed tremendously over a long span of time, centuries in fact, without any obvious direction except its own inner logic, which draws its sources, as Camus shows, from many different places and things.\n\nAt the same time, though, we should also be alive to the genuine malice and wilfulness that seem to motivate official policies of mass immigration in Western nations.\n\nAs a Brit, I well remember the shocking revelations made by Andrew Neather, a former advisor to Tony Blair's New Labour government, which was responsible for introducing mass immigration to Britain beginning in 1997. In about 2010, Neather told a British newspaper that the policy had been specifically formulated to \"rub the right's nose in diversity\" and change the social fabric of Britain forever, so that a truly conservative government could never again be elected.\n\nThere was outcry at the time, and official denials, but why would Neather have made it up? He was simply being honest. Peter Mandelson, a New Labour grandee, said the government actually sent search parties out to Eastern Europe to get people to come to the UK, despite the fact they weren't really needed to fill jobs in the economy.\n\nIf you're an American, or even an observer from the other side of the Pond like me, it's hard to look at what happened in Springfield, Ohio or Charleroi, Pennsylvania or across the entire nation since 2021 and not see a deliberate plan to displace real Americans with foreigners, for political purposes (winning the election) at the very least.\n\nBut there's malice too, no doubt. The absurd, grotesque spectacle of 20,000 cat-eating Haitians being dumped in a small Midwest town bespeaks, to me, a deep hatred of actual Americans that is confirmed by everything else the Biden admin has done for the last four years.\n\nAnyway, I say all of this as a long prelude to the following observation, or rather question: Why is it that, as demographic replacement really begins to bite across the West, governments are so keen to bring in euthanasia services that will only be used by the natives?\n\nFrom the outside, it certainly looks like an evil twist to me, but could it just be happenstance.\n\nWith the release of the latest figures from Canada, which has gone turbo-Great Replacement under its oleaginous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we do at least know that this is the case: that white people are the overwhelming constituency for legal euthanasia.\n\n\"Medically assisted dying\" or \"MAiD\" is used almost entirely by white Canadians. Ninety-six percent of cases are white Canadians. White Canadians make up 67% of the population.\n\nCanadian doctors are now killing 15,000 people a year, more or less all of them white. That's 5% of all deaths in a given year. Many of these people are poor and ill, abandoned by a government and a welfare system that are only too happy to accommodate people with no ties whatsoever to Canada -- to house, feed, employ and care for their health, on the basis of no prior relationship at all.\n\nSome of those who seek MAiD are even veterans who have served Canada in the military. Instead of being offered wheelchair ramps for their homes and new prosthetics, they're offered a lethal injection.\n\nIf other Western countries that have legalised euthanasia -- Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium -- released statistics by ethnicity, I'm sure exactly the same pattern would be visible, just as starkly.\n\nAnd it's not just older people either. As we know from the case of Shanti de Corte or more recently the Belgian woman known only as \"Laura,\" it's young people too. Young people who despair at the state of the world and their countries, whether they know the real reasons for their despair or not. Shanti de Corte suffered PTSD after surviving an Islamist terror attack in Brussels.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I'm not sure what to make of this. But I do know it troubles me deeply. Malice or impersonal logic -- either way, it amounts to the same thing, and it's not good.", "source": {"uri": "infowars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Infowars"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://imagedelivery.net/aeJ6ID7yrMczwy3WKNnwxg/13c3d4ef-8b2b-4709-064c-1ff94dbfb800/w=800,h=450", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 92768, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8429097876", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-26", "time": "05:50:27", "dateTime": "2024-11-26T05:50:27Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-26T05:49:25Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://aninews.in/videos/national/2611-terror-attack-maha-cm-shinde-deputy-cms-fadnavis-ajit-pawar-pay-tribute-on-anniversary/", "title": "Asia's Leading News Site - India News, Business & Political, National & International, Bollywood, Sports | ANI News", "body": "Mumbai, Nov 26 (ANI): November 26, 2024 marked the 16th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack that shook the nation.

President Biden is expected to announce Tuesday that the U.S. and France secured a ceasefire in Lebanon, ending the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a U.S. official.\n\nThe full and permanent ceasefire would end the deadliest war in Lebanon since its civil war ended in 1990.\n\nUnder the deal, a full and permanent ceasefire would be implemented immediately. There will be 60 days permitted for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces -- a gradual withdrawal to allow the Lebanese forces to mobilize and move in to secure the area, but the trigger time is immediate, set to take effect later Tuesday.\n\nThe first peel-off of Israeli troops was to begin within the next 10 days.\n\nHezbollah is expected to pull its forces and heavy weapons back about 20 miles from the Israeli border, to the Litani River.\n\nAn official in Netanyahu's office told CBS News that the prime minister had convened the country's security cabinet to discuss the proposal. The cabinet must approve any ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu was also holding meetings Tuesday in Tel Aviv with various government ministers, lawmakers, and mayors from some of the northern towns that have been evacuated for months.\n\nLebanon's government also had to unilaterally approve the deal on Tuesday, but the U.S. official said that was expected.\n\nNetanyahu was to address his country at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. Eastern) on Tuesday, according to his office, with President Biden then delivering remarks about the agreement in Washington within a few hours.\n\nHezbollah, a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon that has long been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel, started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the war in Gaza with their terror attack the previous day.\n\nIsrael carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it dramatically escalated its assault on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.\n\nCBS News correspondent Debora Patta said rockets were still flying in both directions over Israel's northern border on Tuesday, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date, even as diplomats push for peace.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, Lebanese forces and United Nations peacekeepers are expected to jointly patrol southern Lebanon to ensure the terms of the agreement are adhered to. Earlier reports suggested the southern region would be monitored by a multi-nation committee, which would include both the U.S. and France.\n\nMiddle East expert Danny Citrinowicz, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said the deal looked \"good on paper,\" but added that until it was implemented, \"it would be hard to know whether Israel can really build on these kind of guarantees coming from the U.S. administration.\"\n\nAfter more than a year of crossfire, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon, along with at least 60,000 from towns and villages in northern Israel. They're all desperate to go home, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the chief objective of the war with Hezbollah, from his government's standpoint, has been to enable them to do so.\n\nWhile a deal with Hezbollah appeared closer than ever, negotiations for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Iran's other proxy force in the Gaza Strip, Hamas - have gone nowhere.\n\nMany in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse.

This means the info may not always match what's in the article. Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience.\n\nIsrael and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah appear set to halt the war that has killed almost 3,800 people in Lebanon over the last year and left about 16,000 others wounded. President Biden is expected to announce Tuesday that the U.S. helped secure a ceasefire in Lebanon, ending the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a U.S. official.\n\nUnder the deal, a full and permanent ceasefire would be implemented immediately. There will be 60 days permitted for the full withdrawal of Israeli forces -- a gradual withdrawal to allow the Lebanese forces to mobilize and move in to secure the area, but the trigger time is immediate, set to take effect later Tuesday.\n\nThe first peel-off of Israeli troops was to begin within the next 10 days.\n\nHezbollah is expected to pull its forces and heavy weapons back about 20 miles from the Israeli border, to the Litani River.\n\nAn official in Netanyahu's office told CBS News that the prime minister had convened the country's security cabinet to discuss the proposal. The cabinet must approve any ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu was also holding meetings Tuesday in Tel Aviv with various government ministers, lawmakers and mayors from some of the northern towns that have been evacuated for months.\n\nLebanon's government also had to unilaterally approve the deal on Tuesday, but the U.S. official said that was expected. The ceasefire would end the deadliest war in Lebanon since its civil war, which ended in 1990.\n\nNetanyahu was to address his country at 8 p.m. local time (1 p.m. Eastern) on Tuesday, according to his office, with Mr. Biden then delivering remarks about the agreement in Washington within a few hours.\n\nMr. Biden is expected to mention France when he speaks on Tuesday, according to a U.S. official. The French did not help negotiate the deal, but will be part of its implementation.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's team has been briefed and looks upon the plan favorably, according to the U.S. official. Iran has also been briefed, given Tehran's support of Hezbollah -- a powerful military and political entity in Lebanon that has long been designated a terrorist group by both the U.S. and Israel.\n\n\"We are in the final stages of securing a ceasefire agreement for Lebanon,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Tuesday after meeting with G7 counterparts in Italy. \"We are not there yet, but I believe we are in the final stages.\"\n\n\"This has been an intensive diplomatic effort by the United States, partners like France working with Israel, working with Lebanon, over many months,\" Blinken said, \"and if we get to the conclusion that I hope we reach very soon, it will make a big difference. It will make a big difference in saving lives and livelihoods, in Lebanon and in Israel. It will make a big difference in creating the conditions that will allow people to return to their homes safely in northern Israel and in southern Lebanon.\"\n\nHezbollah started firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of its Hamas allies who sparked the war in Gaza with their terror attack the previous day.\n\nIsrael carried out airstrikes on purported Hezbollah targets for months, but in September it dramatically escalated its assault on the Iranian proxy group, including by launching ground operations in the south of Lebanon.\n\nCBS News correspondent Debora Patta said rockets were still flying in both directions over Israel's northern border on Tuesday, with Israel and Hezbollah trading some of their heaviest fire to date, even as diplomats push for peace.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, Lebanese forces and United Nations peacekeepers are expected to jointly patrol southern Lebanon to ensure the terms of the agreement are adhered to. Earlier reports suggested the southern region would be monitored by a multi-nation committee, which would include both the U.S. and France.\n\nMiddle East expert Danny Citrinowicz, a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, said the deal looked \"good on paper,\" but added that until it was implemented, \"it would be hard to know whether Israel can really build on these kind of guarantees coming from the U.S. administration.\"\n\nAfter more than a year of crossfire, more than 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes in Lebanon, along with at least 60,000 from towns and villages in northern Israel. They're all desperate to go home, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long said the chief objective of the war with Hezbollah, from his government's standpoint, has been to enable them to do so.\n\nWhile a deal with Hezbollah appeared closer than ever, negotiations for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Iran's other proxy force in the Gaza Strip, Hamas - have gone nowhere.\n\nBlinken said Tuesday that de-escalating tensions in the region \"can also help us to end the conflict in Gaza.\"\n\n\"In particular Hamas will know it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war,\" he said.\n\nMany in the decimated Palestinian territory are hungry, and recent rainstorms have made living conditions there even worse. A winter chill has set in, and there were reports of a fresh Israeli strike killing about 15 people Tuesday in Gaza City.\n\nLowrider cars celebrated as cultural symbol among Mexican Americans | 60 Minutes\n\nUATX says it fights college censorship culture with a focus on free speech | 60 Minutes", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dxmyhn8AL.1zeGk_ZnGb0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/124cda88bc483090fb37eef630134a77", "eventUri": "eng-10120785", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 322, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8449988056", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-09", "time": "21:25:03", "dateTime": "2024-12-09T21:25:03Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-09T21:21:03Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "https://freebeacon.com/campus/death-to-jews-inside-the-home-of-2-sjp-leaders-at-george-mason-university-police-find-guns-ammo-and-terrorist-flags/", "title": "'Death to Jews': Inside the Home of 2 SJP Leaders at George Mason University, Police Find Guns, Ammo, and Terrorist Flags", "body": "When police searched the home of two Students for Justice in Palestine leaders, a pair of sisters at George Mason University, their allies painted a sympathetic picture.\n\nThe students were targeted, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), for engaging in \"anti-genocide events on campus.\" The Intercept reported that police found \"antique firearms\" registered to the students' brother and brought gun-related charges as a result of his family's \"pro-Palestine activism.\"\n\nExcluded from those descriptions was the crime the sisters are suspected of committing. A group of student radicals defaced George Mason's student center in August, spray painting messages that warned of a \"student intifada.\" In its coverage of the incident, the Washington Post wrote that \"activists spray-painted words on Wilkins Plaza outside the university's Johnson Center.\"\n\nThose activists caused thousands of dollars in damage, a felony in the state of Virginia, and police suspect the SJP leaders, sisters Jena and Noor Chanaa, led the group of vandals. Weeks after the incident, in November, a county judge granted a warrant -- which is under seal until February, according to a Fairfax County court representative -- allowing police to seize electronics from the Chanaa family home.\n\nWhen officers entered the Chanaa family home, they found firearms -- modern weapons, not antiques -- as well as scores of ammunition and foreign passports, all of which sat in plain view, according to court documents obtained by the Free Beacon and sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nThey also found pro-terror materials, including Hamas and Hezbollah flags and signs that read \"death to America\" and \"death to Jews,\" according to court documents and sources familiar.\n\nPolice seized the weapons under Virginia's red flag law, arguing that Mohammad Chanaa, the students' brother and a George Mason alumnus, was \"linked to destruction of property in connection with a large group of people with like-minded rhetoric\" and posed a danger to others given his possession of \"terroristic\" materials.\n\nOn the day of the search, Nov. 7, law enforcement officials removed \"long guns\" from the residence, sources say. A day later, Mohammad Chanaa voluntarily relinquished his 9mm handgun and concealed carry permit, according to court records. He was not charged with a crime -- Virginia's red flag law gives gun owners 14 days to petition a judge to return their firearms, and Mohammad Chanaa did so on Nov. 21. A Fairfax County circuit court judge granted his request as part of the civil case.\n\nCAIR has denounced the \"draconian measures used by law enforcement authorities\" to \"silence or intimidate those who seek to end the Israeli genocide in Gaza.\" A faculty group at George Mason, meanwhile, released a statement expressing \"deep concern about the apparent targeting of two George Mason students for their advocacy for Palestinian human rights.\"\n\nThe ongoing ordeal -- local police are investigating the incident with the FBI's assistance, sources familiar with that investigation tell the Free Beacon -- reflects CAIR and SJP's status as driving forces behind the anti-Semitic activism that has plagued college campuses in the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel. It also reflects the radical, pro-terror views that have become synonymous with that activism.\n\nBoth Jena and Noor Chanaa have been deeply involved with George Mason's SJP chapter. Jena, a master's student studying civil and infrastructure engineering, served as the chapter's president last school year. Noor, an undergraduate student, took over as co-president this year. Their brother, Mohammad, is a recent George Mason graduate who served in the Springfield, Va., volunteer fire department as recently as Sept. 2023, records show. The three siblings hail from the area and live together in their parents' home.\n\nGeorge Mason did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Fairfax County commonwealth attorney's office, Laura Birnbaum, confirmed that officers found guns, ammunition, and pro-terror materials during their search and declined to comment further.\n\nThe Chanaa family attorney, Abdel-Rahman Hamed, did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to the Washington Post, Hamed said the case marks \"yet another example of the police state targeting American Muslims without cause.\" An \"about\" section on his LinkedIn page states, \"I deny, defy, and defeat Zionists, antisemites, and White Supremacists.\"\n\nUnder Jena and Noor's leadership, George Mason's chapter of SJP has endorsed Hamas and its \"martyrs.\" In a statement issued two days after the Oct. 7 attack, the group lauded the \"liberation of the Palestinian people\" and endorsed \"the right to resist for Palestinians living under the zionist occupation.\" It said \"Palestinian resistance fighters\" mobilized \"into surrounding occupied areas\" on Oct. 7, \"reclaiming land and settlements considered illegal\" in the name of \"decolonization.\"\n\n\"Decolonization entails the struggle for liberation of a colonized people from the grasp of their colonizers,\" the statement read. \"This struggle for the much-sought after liberation from the colonizer is not meant to be metaphysical -- but material.\"\n\n\"Every Palestinian is a civilian even if they hold arms. A settler is an aggressor, a soldier, and an occupier even if they are lounging on our occupied beaches.\"\n\nThe group went on to hold campus protests rallying support for \"Palestinian martyrs\" and \"the resistance.\" On the one-year anniversary of Oct. 7, Jena Chanaa posted a photo of smiling Gazans on top of an Israeli military vehicle. \"One year ago we witnessed Gaza break through the prison doors. No cage will ever be strong enough to hold the colonized,\" she wrote in a caption. \"We have tasted liberation and will free ourselves in this lifetime. Glory to every single martyr in Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen. May the earth burn for Gaza and may we avenge our martyrs every single day.\"\n\nMonths earlier, in a pair of Instagram posts, she wrote that her family comes from \"Taytaba in North Palestine\" and expressed a willingness to \"die in my homeland.\"\n\n\"76 years have passed since the forced expulsion of my family,\" she said. \"76 years of resistance to the occupation. 76 years of steadfastness and determination. 76 years of the complete belief that we will inevitably return.\"\n\nJena and Noor Chanaa and their associates appear to have leveled more aggressive threats toward their school through a pseudonym, using an Instagram account, \"gmuintifada.\" The account posted a video of the Aug. 30 vandalism the sisters are suspected of leading with the caption:\n\nWe, the George Mason University students of conscience, bear witness to the atrocities funded and supplied by our university, and we have chosen to retaliate. During the early hours of Wednesday morning, autonomous students left the imperial George Mason University a message: that the student intifada has been reignited, and that we will honor all the Gazan martyrs who did not live to witness this academic year. University administrations across the nation have convinced themselves that they can suffocate the flames of resistance that have been unleashed since the inception of this genocide. Yet, what they fail to realize is that their every effort to stifle our voices and eradicate our movement for liberation has only provoked an inferno that will engulf all systems of oppression that are upholding the genocide of the steadfast and honorable Palestinians. George Mason University, you will NEVER be able to escape accountability for your role in this genocide. Gaza is our compass and the heart of our noble struggle and the Student Intifada will confront every dousing of our eternal flame of resistance with precision. We will never be extinguished. Resistance until victory, GMU Intifada #escalate4gaza #studentintifada.\n\nShortly thereafter, George Mason police offered a $2,000 reward \"for information leading to the successful arrests of the persons involved in the criminal vandalism incident.\" The \"gmuintifada\" account has since been deleted from Instagram.\n\nIn the wake of the November search on the Chanaa home, George Mason slapped its SJP chapter with an interim suspension, according to a coalition of student groups affiliated with the chapter. University police also served Jena and Noor Chanaa \"with criminal trespass notices barring them from campus for four years,\" according to the Intercept.\n\nCAIR has called on George Mason to rescind those disciplinary measures.\n\nUniversity leaders see the case differently, with George Mason president Gregory Washington calling the school's actions \"justified based on the information available\" in a Nov. 20 faculty senate meeting. So do state and local law enforcement officials.\n\n\"For us at the state and local level, you know, we're concerned,\" one official told the Free Beacon, noting CAIR's ties to illicit fundraising efforts for Hamas as well as recent revelations that Iran has bankrolled anti-Israel campus protests in the United States.\n\n\"It clearly shows the connection between potential radicalization and some of these student groups that are out there,\" the official added. \"It needs to be investigated if these are just sympathies, or is there a road to radicalization?\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "collin_anderson@freebeacon.com", "name": "Collin Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/george-mason.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10159200", "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 250, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8429003539", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-26", "time": "04:13:00", "dateTime": "2024-11-26T04:13:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-26T04:12:25Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9490196108818054, "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/us-news/controversial-muslim-group-cair-forced-to-reveal-sources-of-funding-after-defamation-case-against-former-employee-backfires/", "title": "Exclusive | Controversial Muslim group CAIR forced to reveal sources of funding...", "body": "The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) will be forced to open its books and reveal its sources of funding after a defamation suit it filed against a former employee completely backfired.\n\nUS Magistrate Judge David Schultz ruled Monday that CAIR's donors, funding sources - including potentially foreign ones - and any assets owned by the group are all within the \"scope of permissible discovery\" as part of former chapter leader Lori Saroya's lawsuit against the controversial Muslim rights group.\n\nSaroya filed a federal defamation complaint against CAIR in January after the group dropped its own lawsuit against the former employee, which accused her of embarking on a \"defamation campaign\" against the organization, including by implying that CAIR is funded by foreign governments and terrorist organizations.\n\nCAIR alleged that Saroya's statements - posted on social media, in comment sections and emailed to the group's supporters - damaged the organization's ability to fundraise and build partnerships, but it ultimately dropped the lawsuit in January of 2022 over fears that Saroya's legal team would \"demand the names of CAIR supporters who have donated to us.\"\n\nJeffrey Robbins, Saroya's lawyer, described Monday's ruling as \"the mother of all legal boomerangs.\"\n\n\"It's a very important ruling,\" Robbins said of the Minnesota district court judge's order, in an interview with The Post, noting that the ruling is \"very methodical, very careful, very detailed and very analytical.\"\n\nRobbins explained that the order will force CAIR to \"turn over evidence about everything from fundraising practices, such as having raised money from foreign sources and concealed it; whether it deceived donors; whether it mismanaged donor money; whether it retaliated against employees or threatened to retaliate against employees for raising concerns about sexual harassment or the like.\"\n\nThe judge noted that \"the thrust of CAIR's allegations against Saroya in the 2021 complaint is that Saroya falsely implied CAIR received funding from foreign governments and terrorists when she stated CAIR accepted 'international funding through their Washington Trust Foundation.'\"\n\nSchultz stated that \"CAIR points to no public admission that it received funding from terrorists or that it received funding through the Washington Trust Foundation\" but \"discovery into these matters is proportionate to the needs of the case.\"\n\n\"CAIR has not shown that the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, or that it unwarrantedly taxes its resources,\" he ruled.\n\nFormed in 1994 by a group of young Muslim activists concerned about the rise in anti-Muslim discrimination, CAIR is now the biggest Muslim civil rights group in the US and includes about 33 local chapters across the US.\n\nFederal tax filings show that CAIR received more than $5 million in grants and charitable contributions in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nAs a tax-exempt 501(3) nonprofit organization, CAIR is not typically required to reveal information about the identity of its donors.\n\nA September 2013 Department of Justice Office of Inspector General report on CAIR noted that evidence obtained during a 2008 federal case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development - a Muslim charity organization in the US found to have funneled millions of dollars to the Hamas terror group - \"linked CAIR leaders to Hamas, a specially designated terrorist organization, and CAIR was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.\"\n\nCAIR officials have denied the DOJ OIG's claim.\n\nMore recently, the White House cut ties with CAIR last year after the group's co-founder, Nihad Awad, said he was \"happy\" to witness Hamas' terror attack against Israel on Oct 7.\n\nRobbins told The Post that he didn't want to speculate about what discovery disclosures would reveal about CAIR's funding sources but he said he expects the Minnesota federal court to issue a deadline for the group to fork over the names of its secret donors soon.\n\n\"We served requests that CAIR produce the documents that would show that what Ms. Saroya had said was true, and CAIR took the position that it should not have to turn over those documents,\" he said.\n\n\"So the ruling is almost across the board that CAIR does indeed have to turn over this evidence.\"\n\nSaroya is seeking at least $75,000 in compensation from CAIR and an injunction forcing the group to retract a January 2022 press release which allegedly defames her.\n\nCAIR did not respond to The Post's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-23hlt0cyk-1732592105837.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1732574149&w=1024", "eventUri": "eng-10120582", "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 238, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8447479141", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-08", "time": "05:02:49", "dateTime": "2024-12-08T05:02:49Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-08T05:02:35Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2024/12/07/report-syrian-regime-falls-assad-flees-possible-plane-crash/", "title": "Report: Syrian Regime Falls;

His regime nearly fell in the civil war that erupted during the Arab Spring in 2011, but he was shored up by Russian and Iranian forces.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin used Syria to restore Russia's presence in the Middle East for the first time since the Cold War, while Iran used Syria as a conduit to Hezbollah in Lebanon, sending weapons and advisers.\n\nAssad had bombed rebel-held cities with no regard for civilian life, and torturing suspected rebels and dissidents. President Barack Obama drew a \"red line\" in 2012 when he said the U.S. would intervene militarily if Assad used chemical weapons, but then failed to act.\n\nPresident Donald Trump launched airstrikes against the regime in 2017 after a chemical weapons attack, firing nearly 60 cruise missiles at Syrian air bases, which had the intended effect.\n\nTrump reduced the U.S. troop presence in Syria, though small forces remained to counter threats from the so-called \"Islamic State,\" or ISIS, which still operated in the country. Turkey also had an interest in Syria, targeting Kurdish militias operating in Syrian territory.\n\nBut Assad remained in power, thanks to Russia and Iran. Iran used Hezbollah forces from Lebanon to defend the regime, and they were accused of carrying out atrocities against Sunni regions.\n\nThe Syrian rebels -- including radical Islamist forces affiliated with Al Qaeda -- remained relatively weak. But the Third Lebanon War, which Hezbollah started by firing at Israeli cities after the Hamas terror attack of October 7, 2023, saw Hezbollah weakened and its supply lines disrupted.\n\nIn the wake of the ceasefire in Lebanon, the Syrian rebels, emboldened by Hezbollah's apparent defeat, began making rapid advances, meeting with little resistance.\n\nRussia, tied down by the war in Ukraine, was apparently unable (or unwilling) to intervene. Iran reportedly sent new military advisers, but also evacuated Iranian militias and personnel from the country.\n\nAssad was reported to have pulled his forces back to Damascus for a last stand, but there were reports of defections from his army as the rebels approached. The rebels appear to have used social media successfully to project strength and encourage surrender.\n\nThere were concerns about the fate of Assad's chemical weapons stockpile, which a deal brokered by Obama was supposed to have eliminated (but did not). There were unconfirmed reports that Israel had recently attacked a chemical weapons depot in Syria in an attempt to prevent the materials from falling into rebel hands. The rebels, according to social media reports, have claimed they will not use such weapons; their credibility is uncertain at best.\n\nThere are also concerns about the fate of religious minorities in Syria, particularly Christians.

I refused to take a knee to the machine,\" he says.\n\nThe story begins in the small town of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, on June 11, 2022, where local police got a tip off that a \"little army\" of masked men was in a U-Haul truck en route to disrupt the annual Pride parade.\n\nThey pulled the truck over and arrested 31 young men from the white nationalist group Patriot Front, dressed near-identically in navy tops, chinos and COVID masks, and carrying flagpoles and flags.\n\nThe men, including the group's 25-year-old founder, Thomas Rousseau, were charged with conspiracy to riot, a misdemeanor, and thrown in jail overnight to cool off.\n\nThere was no violence that day but cops were on edge and the FBI was on site because Idaho is an open-carry state and there were several competing events along the Coeur d'Alene lakefront that day, including a local motorcycle-club event to which people were encouraged to bring guns, a Catholic group praying the rosary, and Antifa members ready to do battle.\n\nOne Antifa operative was arrested.\n\nThe Patriot Front arrest was international news because it fit perfectly into the Biden administration's new push to elevate \"white supremacy\" as the biggest terrorist threat to America, based on a false characterization of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot as a white supremacist domestic terror attack, worse than 9/11.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland had unveiled the \"National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism\" exactly a year earlier, saying \"the top domestic-violence extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white race.\"\n\nThe administration was setting a trap for Donald Trump supporters, as President Biden increasingly railed against \"semi-fascist\" \"ultra-MAGA,\" culminating in this year's presidential campaign in which Trump was accused of being Hitler.\n\nThe entire federal law-enforcement apparatus was retooled to respond to this supposedly dire threat of white supremacy.\n\nThe problem was that there were no crimes to find.\n\nSchoffstall was the FBI's supervisory senior resident agent at the time -- in other words, the boss of the FBI in northern Idaho.\n\nHe recalls pressure from Washington to find domestic terrorism in his region because of its sordid history with neo-Nazis such as the Aryan Nations group that had set up a compound near Coeur d'Alene two decades ago.\n\nThe local community is still very sensitive to accusations of white supremacy, but the FBI couldn't just make up crimes that didn't exist.\n\nAt least that's what Schoffstall believed, as he worked on actual crimes like murders, child abuse and drug trafficking.\n\nBut when the Patriot Front turned up in Coeur d'Alene that cloudy Saturday, Garland's henchmen and women at the DOJ seized on the golden opportunity to turn the case into proof of the domestic terrorism threat they had been itching to prosecute.\n\nWhat ensued was a farce that would be comical if it had not destroyed so many lives.\n\nProsecutors wrote elaborate search warrants for the Patriot Front members' phones, citing the J6 \"insurrection,\" and alluding to random neo-Nazi atro\u00adcities.\n\nBut the local FBI agents refused to sign the warrants, says Schoffstall, because they deemed that there was no evidence that the Patriot Front guys were planning to riot and no justification for the over-the-top allegations in the search warrant since the 31 men had no guns, were not violent, had nothing to do with J6 and were a \"lawful group formed for a legitimate activity.\"\n\nThe agents' boss, Schoffstall, examined the evidence and backed his agents.\n\n\"Agents should not be forced to lie under oath -- that's our bread and butter,\" he says.\n\n\"I would never bend the truth or make up evidence to get to the desired end. But I failed to read the room that this was going to happen whether I liked it or not.\"\n\nWhile he says Patriot Front members are \"idiots\" and finds their racist rhetoric abhorrent, that's not a crime.\n\nSchoffstall also says that in the days following the arrests, the FBI counterterrorism headquarters told him, the Idaho US Attorney's Office and the DOJ that \"the Patriot Front and its leader Thomas Rousseau had been thoroughly investigated in the years prior to their arrest in Coeur d'Alene. Those investigations concluded that the Patriot Front was not a criminal organization but a group lawfully formed for First Amendment-protected activities and known to transport its members in box trucks and other vehicles with the same regalia they were arrested with to peacefully protest and/or counterprotest. Rousseau was known to suspend or kick out members who tried to advocate acts of violence .\u2009.\u2009.\n\n\"The DOJ and US Attorney would not accept these conclusions and instead characterized them as a violent right-wing extremist group whose intent, like other right-wing extremist groups on Jan 6th and in Charlottesville was to commit acts of violence.\"\n\nSchoffstall and his agents' conflict with the DOJ escalated to Washington.\n\nSchoffstall stuck to his guns and was transferred, demoted, and finally fired.\n\nDuring his \"removal interview,\" he was told that \"my failure to force a more aggressive investigation of the Patriot Front was extremely poor judgment that they viewed as equivalent to gross misconduct. Hence my dismissal.\"\n\nDespite glowing performance reviews and dozens of character references that poured in from local law enforcement and FBI agents he had worked with attesting to his integrity, he was thrown out of the job he loved.\n\nBut what was it all for?\n\nThe supposed \"domestic terror\" event in Coeur d'Alene fizzled out to nothing.\n\nThe search warrant was signed and 37 devices from the Patriot Front were handed over to the FBI by the police department but no incriminating evidence of violent intent was found.\n\nSeven Patriot Front members were convicted of conspiracy to riot and sentenced to a few days in jail.\n\nTwenty accepted plea deals and were fined for participating in a parade without a permit.\n\nIn other cases, judges castigated prosecutors and said police lacked \"probable cause\" for the arrests.\n\nDespite an order from the Idaho District Court, the FBI refused to hand back the phones -- or the federal warrant used to search them -- to defense attorneys who claimed there was exculpatory evidence that showed their clients did not intend to commit violence.\n\n\"It's mind-blowing to me [the prosecutors] were so obstinate about it,\" says attorney Chris Schwartz, who acted for defendant Richard Jessop, whose case, along with Rousseau's, was dismissed last year.\n\nOne judge called it a \"a crappy case.\"\n\nAnother judge said the trial court had \"no confidence the State ha[d] even yet complied with its discovery obligations.\"\n\nThe DOJ and the FBI ended up providing us with a textbook example all right -- but only of how they have perverted justice in pursuit of politics.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-uqy12ekf0-1732159906145.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1732141952&w=1024", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8462599156", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-18", "time": "03:40:36", "dateTime": "2024-12-18T03:40:36Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-18T03:39:39Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/12/17/pro-palestinian-group-nyc-vows-support-armed-resistance-u-s-israel/", "title": "Pro-Palestinian Group in NYC Vows Support for Armed Resistance Against U.S., Israel", "body": "\"Our rifles will be pointed at the U.S. government and the Zionist entity,\" declared the speaker at a recent pro-Palestinian rally in New York, as he described American \"imperialists\" as the \"number one terrorists,\" and expressed solidarity with Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, Iran, and other members of the \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\nThe pro-Palestinian Bronx Anti-War Coalition, a self-described \"working-class, BIPOC-led, anti-imperialist\" group, organized a rally on Sunday in New York City's Union Square to express solidarity with the \"Axis of Resistance,\" which the group identified as Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and the Iraqi \"resistance.\"\n\nAt the event, a speaker donning a keffiyeh issued sharp proclamations, including: \"Stop pointing fingers at each other.

Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler were on board a Paris-bound train on Aug. 21, 2015, when El Khazzani jumped out of the bathroom and opened fire.\n\nThe now-convicted terrorist had an AK-47 rifle, an automatic pistol, a box cutter and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The rifle jammed and they wrestled the guns away. By then, El Khazzani had shot one passenger, seriously slashed Mark Moogalian, an American ex-pat who was living in France and was first to engage the gunman, and cut Stone multiple times.\n\n\"When we kind of got control of him and had him bent over kind of a table in the train car, he was still fighting to get away, and so I just told him, 'Stop resisting, stop resisting.' And he didn't. So I put the handgun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. And the handgun turned out to be completely empty,\" he said.\n\nSkarlatos cracked him in the head with the butt of the rifle instead as Stone, who nearly lost his thumb, choked him out.\n\nThe former Oregon National Guard sniper said he was afraid to tell French authorities at first.\n\n\"I actually asked the American FBI, who interviewed us the next morning, if it was something that the French would have a problem with,\" he said. \"And they said, no, pretty much it's terrorism. They don't care. You can do whatever you want to terrorists in France. And so when the French federal police interviewed me later that same day, I told them about that.\"\n\nThe three childhood friends received the French Legion of Honor, France's highest award, in 2015. Skarlatos was also given the Army's Soldier's Medal in a ceremony at the Pentagon. Stone, who said later his medical training helped save the life of the fourth passenger who stepped in, Moogalian, received the Airman's Medal and Purple Heart.\n\nAll three were invited to the White House when they returned home.

Watch a Geneva-based NGO, has released parts of a 150-page dossier that Executive Director Hillel Neuer told Fox News Digital shows \"high-level UNRWA staff who are complicit with terrorists, who meet with them regularly.\"\n\nBefore presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini's staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N. Watch's findings and explained that when it released its dossier, Lazzarini would be unable to \"claim... that we do not show you the evidence in advance.\"\n\nUN, ISRAEL AT ODDS OVER CAUSE OF DECLINE IN AID DELIVERIES: 'FALSE NARRATIVES BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'\n\nNeuer's group then released photographs of senior UNRWA staff, including Lazzarini and former UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl, meeting with alleged terror leaders. \"You wouldn't find these photos on [UNRWA officials'] own social media,\" he said. \"We found them our own ways, but they don't post them.\"\n\nNeuer pointed Fox News Digital to two undated photos showing Lazzarini meeting with groups that included members of terror organizations, including the Jihadi Islamic Movement, the Islamic Ansar League, and Hamas.\n\nIn another photo dating back to late 2014, multiple UNRWA regional directors met with senior Hamas member Ali Baraka. Neuer said, and reporting from Al Watan Voice confirms, that the UNRWA staff wanted to \"to congratulate [Baraka] on Hamas' anniversary.\"\n\nIn another instance, Neuer said he was able to find a photo and transcript from a February 2017 meeting between former UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl, Baraka, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and others. According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that \"we are united, and no one can separate us.\"\n\nIn September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice announced \"terrorism, murder conspiracy, and sanctions-evasion charges\" against Baraka and five other Hamas leaders for their roles in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, which killed 40 Americans and over 1,000 others.\n\nUN ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING HAMAS TERRORISTS' USE OF GAZA HOSPITALS AS NEW REPORT IGNORES IMPORTANT DETAILS\n\nKrahenbuhl and his staff were investigated in 2019 for reports of \"sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority.\" Krahenbuhl resigned from his position, but in April 2024 was named the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power \"persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment\" given Krahenbuhl's \"disastrous tenure\" as UNRWA commissioner-general.\n\nFox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the ICRC \"was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion.\"\n\nThey also stated that Krahenbuhl \"has demonstrated through his work at ICRC and his decades of humanitarian experience that he has one objective: to secure aid to civilians in conflict zones. Meeting with any group that controls access to civilians, is an essential part of the ICRC work and other humanitarian organizations in conflict zones.\"\n\nU.N. Watch's latest dossier also includes interviews of UNRWA students taken by local Palestinian film crews over a period of three weeks during the summer of 2024. In one interview, a 14-year-old former student of UNRWA's Ein Arik co-ed school said that his school taught him \"'to fight back and resist' so that 'Palestine will be liberated and our lands will return to us by the good grace of Allah.'\" The child later explains that the solution for Jerusalem is to \"kill the Jews. We get rid of the Jews.\"\n\nA second NGO, IMPACT-se has reported extensively on educational materials used in UNRWA schools for over two decades. In a Nov. 13 report, IMPACT-se names 12 high-ranking UNRWA principals, deputies, directors or deputy directors of training centers who held membership in either Hamas or PIJ. The report notes that nine of the 12 participated in the terror attack of Oct. 7, with \"some even serving as Nukhba operatives,\" members of the special forces units of Hamas. Two of the dual UNRWA- and Hamas-member principals headed schools \"under which Hamas tunnels were built.\"\n\nISRAELI PARLIAMENT BANS UNRWA OVER TERRORISM TIES, FACES INTERNATIONAL BACKLASH\n\nThe latest IMPACT-se review complements findings from March 2023 that two UNRWA schools headed by Hamas members had \"promote[d] violence and terrorism in self-created study material.\" Now, IMPACT-se has named three additional schools where Hamas operatives served as UNRWA staff. The NGO found that these schools promoted \"libels against and non-recognition of Israel\" and \"gratuitously insert[ed] content promoting hatred and violence against Israel into grammar exercises.\"\n\nIMPACT-se found that UNRWA schools are \"shamelessly flout[ing]\" UNESCO standards, which include \"peace-building, respect for non-Palestinian groups, and avoiding incitement to violence.\"\n\nThe group's report cites intelligence claiming that \"over 10% of the 510 [senior] employees in UNRWA's education system in the Gaza Strip,\" are members of PIJ or Hamas. UNRWA members are not allowed to be participants in terror groups designated by the U.N. Security Council. But as Neuer explained, \"The U.N. terror list is one of the thinnest lists in the world,\" because \"Russia and China can block any designation they don't like.\" Neuer said this means \"there's virtually no Palestinian groups\" on the list.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to UNRWA media officials on numerous occasions for its response to the contents of IMPACT-se's and U.N. Watch's dossiers, about allegations that UNRWA schools were not adhering to UNESCO standards, and about Lazzarini's refusal to meet with Neuer.\n\nBill Deere, director of the UNRWA representative office in Washington, told Fox News Digital, \"UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has cautioned the spread of disinformation against UNRWA,\" which he says \"is meant to create chaos and divert attention from the political aims to dismantle the Agency.\" Reiterating the content of a statement Lazzarini shared on X in the aftermath of Neuer's dossier being released, Deere said, \"UNRWA recommends before giving oxygen to accusations like these, double-check the source and question the intent to avoid becoming an echo chamber for disinformation and de facto the fueling of hate and putting other people's lives in danger.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAddressing U.N. Watch's interviews with UNRWA students, he said, \"What they don't tell you is these children were filmed without the knowledge or permission of their parents,\" Deere said. \"The kids were isolated and asked a series of leading questions designed to elicit a response. This is beyond misleading, it's twisted and desperate.\"\n\nThe U.S. was among numerous countries to pause support to UNRWA in January after the initial proofs emerged of members' participation in the terror attack of Oct. 7.

In many metropolises, you should be vigilant in certain public places to protect yourself from any crime.\"\n\nSlowik pointed to neighborhoods with large Arab populations as particular areas of concern.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are certain neighborhoods in which the majority of people of Arab origin live who also have sympathies for terrorist groups,\" she explained.\n\n\"Open anti-Semitism is expressed there against people of Jewish faith and origin. We have initiated over 6,200 investigations since Oct. 7, 2023. A large proportion are hate postings on social media, another large proportion are damage to property, and a significant proportion are propaganda crimes.\"\n\nShe added, however, that 1,300 of these investigations involved violent crimes, many of which were directed at police officers during protests and public gatherings. \"I am very concerned that people from the Jewish-Israeli community in Berlin are aware of the total number of anti-Semitic crimes and that this increases their fear of becoming the target of an attack.\"\n\nProtests against Israel have become a daily occurrence in Berlin following the Israeli response to the Hamas terror attack in October 2023. Slowik detailed the difficulty of managing these intimidating demonstrations, stating, \"Various organizers have been registering meetings regularly since Oct. 7 last year. Sometimes there is hysterical chanting and slogans that are difficult for the majority of society to bear. But all of this is allowed on German roads.\"\n\nWhen asked whether hardcore demonstrators could be quantified, Slowik said, \"We have had over 360 meetings, a large proportion of which were loud. We are registering people in the lower three-digit range who commit crimes at gatherings. However, as the police, we regularly supervise and accompany meetings with thousands of participants who behave largely peacefully.\"\n\nShe acknowledged the challenges of banning demonstrations, which are protected under German law. \"A ban is not a panacea or a permanent solution. After Hamas' attack on Israel, we banned 24 gatherings in the weeks that followed. It was about celebrating those murdered in Israel. So criminal offenses were approved under the guise of the right to assembly. Since then, it has been about current topics that are covered by freedom of expression.\"\n\nBeyond the challenges of managing public safety, Slowik expressed deep concern about the financial state of Berlin's police force. Chronic budget shortfalls have left officers struggling to maintain operations.\n\n\"For years, the police have only been equipped in such a way that the funds are usually spent in the fall, and we then have to juggle our way through until the end of the year and find leftovers, also to finance fuel or to pay support staff for large locations,\" Slowik said.\n\nShe revealed that 2024's investment funds fell far short of requirements. \"This year, instead of \u20ac14 million in investment funds, which we urgently needed, only \u20ac6 million was made available to the (State Criminal Police Office) LKA. This despite the fact that the senator for the interior has already asked all areas of her department to pay in order to support her police. In 2025, we will have even less, even though we have fully justified that we need \u20ac100 million more. Criminals are taking advantage.\"\n\nSlowik stressed the urgent need for technological upgrades, including AI-driven video surveillance, to relieve pressure on officers. \"We urgently need object-related video surveillance, especially at embassies, also using AI. That would relieve us enormously. When it comes to property protection, we have never had such a dire situation.\"\n\nThe lack of funding extends to infrastructure and staffing. Slowik described the dire state of police properties, revealing that the renovation backlog has doubled under her tenure. \"When I took office, the renovation backlog in police properties was \u20ac1.1 billion. It has now grown to \u20ac2.2 billion. This is also and especially due to the increased construction costs, but also because the deterioration of buildings is progressing exponentially.\"\n\nShe also highlighted issues with the police vehicle fleet. \"Our fleet now needs \u20ac50 million immediately in order to be properly positioned again. Up to 40 percent of our cars are in the workshop every day. This will also affect the response times of the radio cars.\"\n\nDespite some improvements, such as modernized control centers and faster water patrol boats, Slowik emphasized that these advancements are overshadowed by the scale of the challenges. \"We currently need 380 law enforcement colleagues from the police and criminal police to support the 1,500 property security forces to meet the calls for protection since Oct. 7. This roughly corresponds to the number of personnel in a police department and two operational units. This will be noticeable in the city,\" she explained.\n\nSlowik's candid remarks underscore the multifaceted challenges facing Berlin's police force.

University officials initially told Taal that the latest incident would lead to his F-1 visa being revoked, Newsweek reported. The Ivy later backed down.\n\nWeeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack in Israel, Trump vowed to deport foreign students who chanted in support of radical Islamic terrorism. He reiterated that promise to donors in May.\n\n\"When I am president we will not allow our colleges to be taken over by violent radicals. If you come from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism or anti-Semitism to our campuses we will immediately deport you. You'll be out of that school,\" Trump said at a rally that same month.\n\nSaid Glick: \"We are strongly supportive of the Trump Administration's plan to deport jihadis who seek to destroy America. Our campuses and our streets are filled with violent people who hate Jews and cannot co-exist with Western society.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Glick was on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers including pro-Israel Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA). Glick was in town to protest a Senate vote on whether to initiate an arms embargo against Israel.\n\nGlick also met with aids to Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and James Lankford.\n\n\"They all gave me the thumbs up and told me how to follow up,\" Glick said.\n\nOn the legislative front, Staten Island Rep.

Rioters continued to protest following the attacks setting a tram aflame on Nov. 11 and intensifying the spotlight on antisemitism throughout Europe.\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told Fox News Digital that his organization \"put a travel advisory on Amsterdam in the immediate aftermath of what happened.\" Cooper explained that the Simon Wiesenthal Center only takes this action \"very rarely\" and after serious deliberation.\n\nTRAM SET ON FIRE AS AMSTERDAM RIOTS RAGE ON\n\n\"Theoretically,\" Cooper added, \"you can slap a travel advisory on almost every place in Western Europe.\" As Cooper explained, \"the establishment has never stepped forward in any really major way across Europe to safeguard their Jews and guarantee their rights and their religious freedoms.\"\n\nFollowing Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, there has been a staggering increase in antisemitism across Europe. In May, citing data from the World Zionist Organization, Ynetnews reported an 800% increase in antisemitic incidents in Sweden over the previous year, as well as a 680% increase in Spain, a 450% increase in the Netherlands, a 442% increase in the UK and a 433% increase in France.\n\nEvents in Amsterdam appeared to be a flashpoint for further hate. On Nov. 10, Belgian authorities arrested five individuals after calls appeared on social media for a \"Jew Hunt\" in the Jewish Quarter of Antwerp, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nIn Greece in mid-November, protests featuring pro-Palestinian activists became so volatile that the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry advised Israelis to avoid the Embassy and certain other areas and to remove identifying symbols, the Jerusalem Post reported. Far from the first anti-Israel demonstration in Greece, in June, nine Europeans were under consideration for deportation following \"disruptive anti-Israel demonstrations\" at the University of Athens School of Law.\n\nNETANYAHU CONDEMNS ANTISEMITIC POGROM IN AMSTERDAM, WARNS WORLD LEADERS ATTACKS WILL SPREAD IF DON'T ACT\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that an under-17 youth soccer team in Berlin was \"chased and assaulted\" on Nov. 7 by a knife- and stick-wielding crowd screaming, \"Free Palestine.\" The Times of Israel reported that fewer than two weeks later, the Berlin Chief of Police told Jewish and gay residents to \"be careful\" in neighborhoods with high populations of Arabs. \"Unfortunately, there are certain neighborhoods where there are mostly Arab people who also have sympathy for terrorist groups,\" she explained.\n\nThe expansion of at-risk groups in Berlin echoes the warning words of Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal. As Cooper explained, his organization's founder readily emphasized, \"It often starts with the Jews. It never ends with the Jews.\"\n\nIn the atmosphere of tension and hate, Cooper noted that Jewish Europeans are engaging in \"conditioning and self-censorship,\" removing yarmulkes, or taking the Jewish \"chai\" symbols from their necklaces. Cooper said that it has \"probably been about 15 years since a Jewish person felt comfortable walking to synagogue wearing a kippah in Amsterdam.\"\n\nCooper's concerns are borne out by media reports. As one Dutch Jewish citizen told Ynetnews, Jews visiting the Netherlands should not wear identifying items or \"bring Israeli passports.\" The Times reported in October that many Irish Jews are likewise removing identifying symbols due to an environment of mistrust.\n\nIn France, Jewish citizens are removing mezuzahs from their doors, avoiding riding in Ubers, and even changing their names to protect themselves from being identified and targeted with hate when they receive deliveries, according to the Christian Science Monitor. In 2023, France recorded 1,676 antisemitic incidents, compared with 436 the prior year. About 1,200 French Jews began applications to emigrate to Israel in 2023, an increase of 430% from 2022.\n\nADDRESSING ANTISEMITISM SHOULD BE PRIORITY FOR EUROPE BEFORE RECOGNIZING PALESTINIAN STATE, LEADING RABBI SAYS\n\nAs Cooper explained, it is \"enormously painful to look across Europe and to see that they give their due deference one or two days a year to dead Jews. They still haven't figured out in Europe how to live and embrace and celebrate Jewish presence in their societies.\"\n\nWith increased hate in Europe possibly impacting Americans traveling overseas, Fox News Digital asked the U.S. State Department whether it would issue travel advisories warning Jewish Americans of antisemitism abroad.\n\n\"We take seriously our commitment to provide U.S. citizens with clear, timely, and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions,\" a spokesperson said. \"We use standard formats for our Travel Advisories and Alerts to help U.S. citizens find and use important security information easily.

On Oct. 7, just as the crew was arriving in the Red Sea for duty with the 5th Fleet, Hamas fighters invaded Israel in a massive terror attack, killing over 1,000. Within days, the Carney was on the front line of a rapidly escalating combat.\n\n\"The XO told us flat out what the situation was, and what we could be facing,\" said Gunner's Mate 1st Class Charles Currie, a Mk. 45 gun technician. \"At that point the crew just started to get ready.\"\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen, backed by Iranian hardware, began firing missiles and drones at civilian merchant ships in the Red Sea, in an attempt to choke the vital trade route. The Carney quickly found itself as the primary U.S. Navy ship standing in the way.\n\nOn October 19, the Houthis took aim at the Carney.\n\nThe Navy released new details this week of that fight, including comments from crew members like Miller who found their expectations of placid duty and fun port calls swept away by a cruise that, when finished, faced 51 engagements.\n\nThe Oct. 19 battle began so unexpectedly that one crew member was initially confused by the ship-wide announcement.\n\n\"We were in berthing and heard [an announcement over the ship's 1MC intercom system] 'clear the weatherdecks,' and I remember thinking, 'what does that mean? I've never heard that before,'\" said Fire Controlman (AEGIS) 2nd Class Justin Parker, a SPY radar technician assigned to Carney.\n\nImmediately after the announcement, Parker heard the sound of missiles being fired off the ship, as well as the destroyer's main 5-inch guns. All aboard understood what it meant -- there were no scheduled live fire drills.\n\n\"We had never done anything like this before -- we had only trained to it,\" recalled Currie. \"There was a lot of adrenaline going on. This was real-world now.\"\n\nThe Carney is an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the Navy's primary class of ships tasked with protecting fleets from air attack. With a crew of over 300, the ship is armed with machine guns, 5-inch cannons and as many as 90 anti-aircraft missiles, along with separate suites of weapons for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations.\n\nBy the end of what became a 10-hour standoff, Carney had shot down 15 drones and four land-attack cruise missiles, an engagement the Navy called \"the most intense combat engagement by a U.S. Navy warship since World War II.\"\n\nAs the fight began and the ship defended itself, sailors said they remained calm.\n\n\"As nervous as you get, it's not about you,\" said Ensign William Hinckley, the ship's legal officer. \"It's about keeping everybody else safe. Thinking about everybody else and not just yourself is crucial.\"\n\nOver the next five months, the Carney engaged a threat no U.S. ship had faced before: Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, massive rockets fired designed specifically to sink ships like the Carney.\n\n\"The Houthis are the first entity in the history of the world to use anti-ship ballistic missiles ever,\" Vice Adm. Brad Cooper told 60 Minutes in February. \"No one has ever used an anti-ship ballistic missile certainly against commercial shipping, much less against U.S. Navy ships.\"\n\nF/A-18 Super Hornets and E/A-18 Growlers from the USS Eisenhower also engaged the ASBM, but the crew of the Carney faced them knowing they were the target.\n\n\"The ASBM threat is very challenging. It's very dynamic and it's very fast,\" said Cmdr. Jeremy Robertson, commanding officer of USS Carney in May. \"Because of that, we have to have 100% confidence in my [Tactical Action Officers] and all of the watch teams and all of the systems that we have that are designed to detect that and make sure that the ship is protecting itself.\"\n\nOn Dec. 16, the Carney took out another 14 drones, according to reporting in The War Zone.\n\nLt. j.g. Haven Vickers, the anti-submarine warfare officer assigned to the Carney, said the crew knew what to do. \"Every single training experience we did before deployment - that's what we fell back on,\" Vickers said.\n\nThe Carney returned to Florida in May. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti awarded the ship the Combat Action Ribbon (CAR), the first time a Navy crew has received the decoration since 1991 in the Gulf War.\n\n\"I could not be more proud of what the Carney team has done since September,\" said Franchetti. \"It has been eye-watering to watch; you truly are America's Warfighting Navy in action.\"\n\n\"It was probably one of the most rewarding experiences I'll ever have in my entire life,\" said Miller. \"It wasn't just about traveling the world; it was about saving people's lives and getting a job done.\"", "source": {"uri": "taskandpurpose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Task & Purpose"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_white@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Matt White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://taskandpurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/452589323_935863808571961_8509698147995448336_n-e1733513386798.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 78, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8458700039", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-15", "time": "14:34:45", "dateTime": "2024-12-15T14:34:45Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-15T14:33:38Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/12/15/israel-closes-embassy-ireland/", "title": "Israel Closes Dublin Embassy After Ireland Joins South Africa's 'Genocide' Case", "body": "Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, announced Sunday that the country would be closing its embassy in Ireland, following that country's decision to join South Africa's \"genocide\" claim at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nSouth Africa has sued Israel at the ICJ, claiming that it is committing \"genocide\" in response to the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. South Africa's case has elements of classic antisemitism, including the argument that Jews do not have the right to defend themselves when attacked, and misquotes of the Bible and Jewish teachings to claim that Jews are quilty a unique and religiously-motivated evil. It does not even acknowledge Hamas's genocidal ideology.\n\nSouth Africa's case has failed to gain much traction, even before a sympathetic court that is biased against Israel. Nevertheless, the government decided last week to join South Africa's \"genocide\" case -- although critics noted it changed the definition of \"genocide\" in doing so. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, for example, observed: \"Ireland will also urge the court to develop and use a broader definition of the term \"genocide.\"\n\nThe Times of Israel reported:\n\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa'ar announces he will be closing Israel's embassy in Ireland, citing the \"extreme anti-Israel policy of the Irish government.\"\n\n...\n\n\"The antisemitic actions and rhetoric that Ireland is taking against Israel are based on delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state and on double standards,\" says Sa'ar in a statement. \"Ireland has crossed all red lines in its relationship with Israel. Israel will invest its resources in promoting bilateral relations with the countries of the world according to priorities that are also derived from the attitude of the various countries towards it.\"\n\nAt the same time, Sa'ar announces that Israel will open an embassy in Moldova, which already has an embassy in Israel. The opening is expected to occur in the next year, and Israel is beginning the process of finding a site and appointing an ambassador.\n\nIsrael had recalled its ambassador from Ireland in May after it joined Spain and Norway in recognizing a Palestinian state. Such a state does not physically exist; recognition effectively rewards Hamas for the October 7 terror attack.\n\nThere has long been sympathy for the Palestinian cause within the movement for Irish sovereignty over the entire island, including the six counties of Northern Ireland that are part of the United Kingdom. Both causes have also harbored terrorist elements. The difference is that the Irish Republican Army eventually agreed to stop violence; Hamas and the Palestinian cause have never ceased to use terrorism and refuse to accept the existence of Israel.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

JB Pritzker are seeking to \"dismantle Western democracies, values and culture,\" according to internal Heritage documents obtained by the Forward.\n\nThe documents, a pitch deck that Heritage used in trying to build support from Jewish foundations and other organizations, also outline several tactics the group plans to use to undermine a collection of anti-Zionist nonprofits and progressive groups that it refers to as the Hamas Support Network. The actions include identifying \"foreign members vulnerable to deportation\" and enlisting law enforcement to \"generate uncomfortable conditions\" for progressive activists.\n\nHeritage did not respond to an inquiry Friday about the presentation.\n\nThe think tank, which also produced the controversial Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump administration, has struggled to attract Jewish supporters for its antisemitism plan, which appears to have been assembled by several evangelical Christian groups.\n\nProject Esther focuses exclusively on left-wing critics of Israel, ignoring the antisemitism problems from white supremacists and other far-right groups. James Carafano, who runs the Heritage Foundation's antisemitism task force, said in October that \"white supremacists are not my problem because white supremacists are not part of being conservative.\"\n\nThe promotional presentation includes two slides headlined \"antisemitism's ecosystem.\" One features a pyramid topped by a list of \"progressive 'elites' leading the way.\" In addition to Soros and his son Alex, who run the Open Society Foundations, it also includes the Pritzker family and the Marxist academic and author Angela Davis.\n\nGeorge Soros has funded a variety of progressive causes and long been a boogeyman among conservatives; Alex recently took over the family foundation. It's less clear why JB Pritzker, who was first elected governor of Illinois in 2018, was on the list, or his broader family -- his sister Penny, who served as a Commerce Secretary under President Barack Obama and a special envoy for Ukraine in the Biden administration, is on the board of Harvard University and has compared pro-Palestinian protesters at the school to the Klu Klux Klan.\n\nPolitico reported in May that Pritzker family members ran a foundation that funded groups, including Climate Justice Alliance, which had also participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. But subsequent reporting cast doubt on those ties..\n\n\"That's a completely false story,\" JB Pritzker said of the Politico article at the time. He also chided the Chicago City Council for calling for a ceasefire in Gaza early this year.\n\nPritzker's office did not respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nHeritage also accused lesser-known individuals of leading the network, including Neville Singham, who The New York Times has described as a charismatic millionaire \"known as a socialist benefactor of far-left causes;\" and Manolo de los Santos, who runs a \"movement incubator\" in New York City.\n\nThe pitch deck draws lines from these figures to \"Backers,\" including foundations both large and small, like Tides, which helps individual donors funnel more than $1 billion to various liberal nonprofits; the Rockefeller Brothers Fund; and Wespac, a tiny charity that sponsors several of the most radical pro-Palestinian groups in the country (and whose board chair is Jewish. Activist movements like Antifa and Black Lives Matter are also included on that tier, below which are \"organizers,\" including the nonprofit groups Jewish Voice for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine and Fight Back, the arm of a Chicago construction workers union.\n\nIn the presentation, the work of these leaders, funders and organizations is described as \"violent activity\" directed at Jews, including \"riots.\" One slide includes a photo of a violent 2017 demonstration in Paris.\n\nProject Esther's strategy to \"neutralize\" this network, according to the documents, includes six distinct \"lines of effort\" with different outcomes.\n\nThe version of the plan publicly released on the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack in Israel, had criticized American Jewish organizations for not taking the threat posed by the \"Hamas Support Network\" seriously enough. The pitch deck says that Heritage plans to \"conduct tailored outreach\" to Jews and identify \"key influencers\" who can help unify the community behind Heritage's strategy.\n\nReferring to the activist network as a \"cancer,\" the group also calls for passing legislation to counter it at the federal, state and local levels. One goal is to get groups designated as \"TSEs,\" an abbreviation for \"terrorism support entity,\" which can have severe legal consequences.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make fighting antisemitism a priority in his administration. He has suggested that he's open to at least some of the tactics referenced in Project Esther, including deporting international students who protest against Israel.

However, al-Ali has not yet returned to Lebanon, according to his family.\n\nSome of the missing Chistians were political activists; others were members of Christian militias that had been active during the Lebanese civil wars of the 20th century.\n\nSyria dominated Lebanon for decades until it was eclipsed by Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, who propped up a faltering Assad regime while continuing to dominate Lebanese politics.\n\nMany commenters on social media are outraged at former Lebanese President Michel Aoun, a Christian, for taking Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad at his word when the latter claimed that there were no more Lebanese prisoners in Syria.\n\nSome are praising Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose leadership of Israel during the ongoing war that was started by Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah last October ultimately resulted in the decimation of Hezbollah and the elimination of its leadership, leaving Assad defenseless.\n\nOthers faulted the Iranian regime itself, whose strategy of surrounding Israel with a \"ring of fire\" consisting of terrorist proxies ultimately failed with Hamas's decision to launch the brutal October 7 terror attack, which underestimated the strength of the Israeli response.\n\nWhile there is still widespread concern about the fate of Christians inside Syria, especially since the Syrian rebels who overthrew Assad are radical Islamists with ties to terror, there is broad delight at the demise of the Syrian regime.\n\nJoel B.

The bomb-making instructions allegedly included the suggestion that packing the explosive with 30 mm aluminum ball bearings, for shrapnel, \"will do the trick.\"\n\nHassan told the informant how to surveil the consulate and how to escape to ISIS territory after the attack, and also suggested he could \"lay havoc on them with an assault rifle\" instead of a bomb. He also told the informant to livestream the attack so Hassan could give the footage to ISIS.\n\nThe conversations took place last month and this month, the complaint said.\n\nHassan, who according to a court filing was arrested on December 17, is accused of crimes related to distributing information on explosives and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nOfir Akunis, Israeli's consul-general in New York, thanked US security services for thwarting the planned attack.\n\n\"This attempted attack by terror organizations is an attack on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel in its entirety,\" Akunis said in a Thursday statement to The Times of Israel.\" \"It's proof that terror knows no boundaries and that we must fight it everywhere and every time.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the US Justice Department on the arrest.\n\nAuthorities have prevented other recent terror attacks against Jews in New York.\n\nIn September, a suspect was arrested in Canada while attempting to enter the US to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of ISIS.\n\nAnd In July, a neo-Nazi was indicted for planning mass casualty attacks against Jews in New York City by distributing poisoned candy to Jewish children.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "getty_images@timesofisrael.com", "name": "Getty Images", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20231009__1726474446__v1__HighRes__NewYorkRallyHeldInSupportOfGazaAsIsraelAndHa-e1734647342695.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10189659", "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 68, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8434735240", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-29", "time": "12:34:41", "dateTime": "2024-11-29T12:34:41Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-29T12:34:19Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "url": "https://www.westernjournal.com/islamist-nightmare-school-girl-confesses-trick-ended-innocent-teachers-beheading/", "title": "Islamist Nightmare: School Girl Confesses Trick That Ended in Innocent Teacher's Beheading", "body": "A new detail has emerged in the 2020 murder of a 47-year-old schoolteacher in France.\n\nSamuel Paty was murdered by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee, Abdoullakh Anzorov, on Oct. 16, 2020, the U.K.'s Daily Mail reported.

That led to the conclusion, backed by a nearly 300-page report and more than 200 interviews, that the Genocide Convention's requirement of \"intent\" applies.\n\n\"We could find only one reasonable inference and conclusion,\" said Agn\u00e8s Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty, \"which is that, either in addition to -- or in order to -- deliver military objectives Israel intended to commit genocide.\"\n\nPrevious reports from both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch accusing Israel of apartheid helped cement that view among international rights groups. Human Rights Watch has not made a determination as to whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe accusation that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians predates the current war, but became far more pronounced and widespread after Israel began its furious response to the attack last October in which Palestinian terrorists killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped another 250. Israel dropped more than 29,000 bombs on the 141-square-mile territory in two months; international officials say more than 44,000 Palestinians in the strip have been killed to date, and nearly all of Gaza's 2 million residents displaced and at risk of starvation.\n\nDozens of legal scholars and academics initially warned of a \"potential genocide\" in Gaza. The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention described it as a genocide in December 2023, and Genocide Watch, a monitoring group, said in Febraury that Israel's activity had \"included many acts of genocide.\" The International Court of Justice ruled that it was \"plausible\" Israel's actions amounted to genocide that same month, and in May a consortium of international law experts from Yale, Cornell and Boston University said that Israel was committing genocide.\n\nThose allegations have been met with derision by Israel and its defenders, who generally say that Palestinian civilian casualties have been exaggerated and that Hamas is to blame for them because it embeds its fighters in dense urban areas and steals aid.\n\nArsen Ostrovsky, chief of the International Legal Forum, a pro-Israel group, called the Amnesty report \"nothing short of a blood libel against the Jewish state.\"\n\nOren Marmorstein, an Israeli government spokesperson, denounced the report a week before it was even released, telling the New York Post: \"The deplorable and fanatical organization Amnesty International has produced a fabricated report entirely based on lies.\"\n\nIn its report, Amnesty says that it reviewed statements by Israeli government and military officials, and their submissions to the Israel Supreme Court, but had \"received no substantive answers\" to letters sent to Israeli authorities between Oct. 30, 2023, and Oct. 16, 2024, requesting meetings and information.\n\nMuch of Amnesty's report consists of detailing damage to civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including the destruction of mosques and universities that did not appear to have any connection to Hamas. By July, the group says, 63% of all structures in Gaza had been damaged or destroyed, including 85% of all schools.\n\n\"It's known they are fighting Hamas and one might suppose that they'd bomb any place in which it would seek refuge, but when they bomb the Gaza public library, the unknown soldier monument, the Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Centre -- where Bill Clinton met with the legislative council -- they're bombing the city's landmarks,\" a municipal worker in Gaza City told Amnesty researchers. \"Their intent is for the city to have a different face after the war.\"\n\nBut international law does not define the crime of genocide solely based on the extent of destruction or even death in a designated group. It requires that the violence against that group be done with \"specific intent\" to destroy it, at least in part, which is often difficult or impossible to prove. Amnesty pointed to what it described as statements from senior Israeli officials encouraging the destruction of Palestinian society in Gaza and erasing distinctions between combatants and civilians.\n\nFor example, a few days after Oct. 7, Gen. Ghassan Alian, who manages the unit in charge of Palestinian civilian life in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, recorded a video in Arabic promising to punish the local population.\n\n\"The citizens of Gaza are celebrating, instead of being horrified,\" Alien said in the video. \"With such human beasts, we will deal accordingly. Israel has imposed a complete blockade on Gaza. You will not have electricity or water, just destruction. You want hell, you'll get hell.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted several references by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"Amalek,\" the Israelites' biblical enemy, which God commanded the Jewish people to exterminate completely.\n\nCallamard, the French human rights attorney who has run Amnesty since 2021, said at a Wednesday briefing for reporters that Israeli soldiers in Gaza appeared to have acted on these statements. \"I am coming to conquer Gaza ... to blot out the memory of Amalek,\" soldiers sing in one video referenced in the report. \"We know our slogan: 'There are no uninvolved civilians.'\"\n\nIsraeli military and political officials say their soldiers take extensive measures to protect Palestinian civilians, including delivering warnings in advance of strikes and issuing evacuation orders, But Amnesty said in its report that these measures were insufficient and sometimes have themselves represented violations of international laws regarding warfare.\n\nThe report said, for example, that Israel had issued 59 different evacuation orders since the war began that were \"sweeping, often incomprehensible to the local population, misleading and arbitrary.\"\n\nOstrovsky, the legal scholar, and organizations including Genocide Watch have also accused Hamas of committing acts of genocide in its Oct. 7 attack against Israel. At Wednesday's briefing, Amnesty officials did not respond to a question about whether they had evaluated that question.\n\nBut Amnesty did say that it is in the process of completing a second, comprehensive report on the violence committed by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on Oct. 7, and that some of their actions -- including \"deliberate mass killings\" in Israel -- constituted war crimes.\n\nThe organization also acknowledged that \"Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups endangered Palestinian civilians through their conduct by operating from, or in the vicinity of, densely populated residential areas.\" But Amnesty noted that fact \"does not release Israel from its own obligations under international humanitarian law.\"\n\nThe report calls on Israel and Hamas to reach an immediate ceasefire, and for Hamas to release all Israeli hostages it is currently holding and allow the Red Cross to visit those in captivity. Some 100 hostages remain in captivity, though at least a third are believed dead.\n\nAmnesty tends to take a more emotional approach to its advocacy than some other human rights groups, and that was on display during Wednesday's briefing unveiling the genocide report. Cammard repeatedly criticized international governments for failing to take enough action to stop the war and described the organization's research as having been conducted with \"blood, with commitment, with anger.\"\n\nBudour Hassan, an Amnesty researcher in Israel and the West Bank, described the influence of Gaza residents who shared their stories with her team: \"They wanted to tell the world that what is happening has only one name and we should not be shy of saying that name: It is genocide.\"", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arno_rosenfeld@forward.com", "name": "Arno Rosenfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1225711060-scaled.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10135399", "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 67, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8448483379", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-09", "time": "00:06:09", "dateTime": "2024-12-09T00:06:09Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-09T00:06:01Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.theblaze.com/abide/biblical-prophecy-and-israel-are-predictions-unfolding-before-our-eyes", "title": "Biblical prophecy and Israel: Are predictions unfolding before our eyes? | Blaze Media", "body": "'I don't believe Israel's under judgment. ... In other words, God didn't send this enemy, but God ... allowed it.'\n\nAuthor Joel Rosenberg believes some of the events unfolding around us hold biblical significance, particularly when it comes to Israel and the Middle East.\n\nRosenberg, an expert on biblical prophecy who now lives in Israel, recently spoke with CBN News about Hamas, the war in Gaza, and how current events might play into what the Bible says about future happenings and the end of days.\n\n\"That is the No. 1 question I'm getting asked. ... 'Can you put this [current moment] in a prophetic context?'\" Rosenberg said. \"I would say, No. 1, we're definitely in a birth pang, right? Jesus speaks in Matthew 24 that there's going to be contractions and releases, moments of wars and rumors of wars, and kingdom against kingdom, nation against nation, as well as earthquakes and famines and other disasters.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Those are contractions, and just like when your wife gets close to delivering ... the contractions are longer and more painful, and the release moments are shorter.\"\n\nRosenberg said Israelis were living in a time of release on Oct. 6, 2023, as it was safe, prosperous, and secure -- the safest it had been in modern history.\n\n\"You'd have to go back to the days of Solomon and David when the kingdom was peaceful and secure,\" he said, noting that Israel had just come off making four Arab-Israeli peace treaties and normalization treaties via the Abraham Accords. \"We were just about to finalize another deal -- the biggest peace and normalization deal in Israeli history -- and that would be with the Saudi government.\"\n\nBut all of that peace was obliterated by Hamas' horrific terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, an event he said was the \"longest contraction\" modern Israel has faced.\n\n\"I would add that, just in context, I believe COVID was a biblical Matthew 24 contraction where ... a lot of people died. But the other part was ... not only was there this terrible health pandemic, plague, a biblical plague, but even the American government could say in an instant, 'You can't go to church. You can't leave your house. You can't go see your friends, but the strip clubs could stay open. The casinos could stay open. The bars could stay open, the liquor stores, but not churches. That was a contraction.\"\n\n'There's no question in my mind that we're seeing the chess pieces on the board align in a manner that's consistent with the prerequisites of Ezekiel 38-39.'\n\nAnother contraction, he said, is Russia's prolonged war in Ukraine, a chaotic and deadly ongoing event further creating international stability.\n\nRosenberg cited Amos 9:9 while discussing Israel's current war after the Hamas invasion. That verse reads (NIV): \"For I will give the command, and I will shake the people of Israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, and not a pebble will reach the ground.\"\n\nHe believes Amos 9:9 is a recurring prophecy but that the current war in Israel is another \"shaking\" that falls under its umbrella.\n\n\"I don't believe Israel's under judgment. ... In other words, God didn't send this enemy, but God ... allowed it,\" Rosenberg said. \"Why? To shake us, to help us realize that most Israelis either haven't read, don't remember, or don't care about Psalm 23, in which David, our greatest king, told us the Lord is our shepherd.\"\n\nHe said some Israelis forgot, due to security, the realities inherent in this scripture.\n\n\"We forgot as a nation that there are ravenous wolves trying to destroy us,\" he said. \"It shows what a moment of release of security we felt like we were in. But I think this is a wake-up call.\"\n\nAs for the Palestinians of Gaza, Rosenberg said he believes they are facing a \"biblical judgment,\" appealing to Genesis 12:1-3 (NIV) to make his case. Those verses read:\n\nThe Lord had said to Abram, \"Go from your country, your people and your father's household to the land I will show you. \"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\"\n\nRosenberg said the Abrahamic Covenant makes it clear that God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who do not.\n\n\"If you curse Israel every day for 76 years, and you want to ... elect a genocidal government, even if later you don't want that, but what are you going to do now?\" he said. \"I believe we're seeing a judgment. Doesn't mean God doesn't want to show mercy. Also, we need to pray as Christians. Who else is praying for the Palestinians? We need to be. We need to show compassion. But there's a judgment going on from 76 years of hatred, hostility, cursing, and now, you know, an attempt at genocide against Israel and the Jewish people.\"\n\nConsidering the prophetic verses in Bible books like Ezekiel -- particularly the Gog and Magog prophecy -- Rosenberg broke down his beliefs on what's happening now and how it might relate.\n\n\"In terms of watching where we are going, there's no question in my mind that we're seeing the chess pieces on the board align in a manner that's consistent with the prerequisites of Ezekiel 38-39 happening, the war of Gog and Magog,\" Rosenberg said, referring to the Bible chapters that purportedly predict Russia, Iran, and Turkey attempting to invade Israel.\n\nBut Rosenberg was also careful in addressing these issues, reminding Christians not to read too closely into what's happening. He said dynamics can and do quickly shift.\n\n\"I just want to caution people who are interested in those prophecies ... don't try to jump to a fast conclusion,\" he said. \"The data doesn't support yet a conclusion, but it definitely supports [the premise], 'Isn't this interesting?'\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/biblical-prophecy-and-israel-are-predictions-unfolding-before-our-eyes.jpg?id=55157652&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C27%2C0%2C28", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 66, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8423019021", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-21", "time": "23:11:42", "dateTime": "2024-11-21T23:11:42Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-21T23:11:09Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8470588326454163, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-news-digital-crushes-cnn-ny-times-other-major-news-brands-key-metrics-during-october", "title": "Fox News Digital crushes CNN, NY Times, other major news brands in key metrics during October", "body": "Fox News host Sean Hannity reacts to President-elect Donald Trumps popularity as he makes his way back to the White House on Hannity.\n\nAmericans continued to rely on Fox News Digital for information and analysis ahead of the critical presidential election.\n\nThe month of October featured around-the-clock buildup to the battle between President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, including Trump's serving French fries at a Pennsylvania McDonald's, along with devastating hurricanes hitting the southeast United States, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the somber one-year anniversary of the Hamas' terror attack on Israel, port workers going on strike, the Vice Presidential debate between Sen.

It was not clear from the footage where all the shots emanated from.\n\nThe attack came after three Israelis were lightly injured by gunfire the previous night while visiting Joseph's Tomb in the Palestinian city of Nablus without coordinating with the military, and also followed a car-ramming attack in the southern West Bank over the weekend in which a soldier was seriously wounded.\n\nViolence has risen sharply in the West Bank since the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\n\nSince then, 42 people, including Israeli security personnel, have been killed in terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Another six members of the security forces were killed in clashes with operatives in the West Bank amid a major counterterrorism offensive that has been accompanied by sharp restrictions on Palestinian movement.\n\nIsraeli troops have arrested some 5,250 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank as part of the post-October 7 military operations, including more than 2,050 affiliated with Hamas.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Authority health ministry, some 800 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in the same span of time.

Its strongman leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n sent a letter condemning the decision and inviting Netanyahu for an official visit on which he promised to \"ensure your safety and freedom.\"\n\nThe Israeli leader praised Hungary, who he said had \"like our friends in the U.S.,\" shown \"moral clarity and steadfastness on the side of justice and the truth.\" He contrasted this to what he called the \"shameful weakness of those who have lined up alongside the outrageous decision.\"\n\nThe White House said Thursday that President Joe Biden's administration was \"deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.\"\n\nNeither Israel nor the U.S. recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICC, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and has no police to enforce its warrants.\n\nUnder the Rome statute that created the ICC, its signatories are obliged to carry out arrest warrants, no matter the rank of the accused. But most governments also abide by the international legal principle that heads of state have legal immunity from other courts.\n\nThe court said in its statement that there was reason to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant used \"starvation as a method of warfare\" by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel's campaign in Gaza -- charges Israeli officials dismissed as false and antisemitic.\n\nThe arrest warrants were announced on the same day that the death toll in the enclave passed 44,000, according to local officials, and followed mounting international condemnation over the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave. The World Health Organization has warned that northern Gaza is at imminent risk of famine, while health organizations have deemed it necessary to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of children for polio in recent months.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign following the Oct. 7 terror attack in which Israeli officials said some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, a major escalation in the decadeslong conflict.\n\nMohammed Deif was accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including for his role as a mastermind of Oct. 7.\n\nSome European countries have not said whether they would arrest Netanyahu if he visited, including a number of Israeli allies.\n\nBritain respects the independence of the ICC, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson said, but did not say whether Britain would arrest Netanyahu.\n\nFrance restated its commitment to the court's independence and said its response would align with the statutes of the court, but a spokesperson for its foreign ministry did not explicitly say how Paris would act.\n\nThe German government noted its role in drafting the ICC statutes but also its relationship with Israel, vowing to \"carefully examine\" the next steps.\n\nOthers, including Sweden and Norway, were also noncommittal.\n\nSome appeared split, with both Austrian and Czech governments promising to uphold their obligations to the ICC while senior officials criticized the arrest warrants.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the ICC decision \"unfortunate,\" saying on X late on Thursday that it \"undermines its authority in other cases when it equates the elected representatives of a democratic state with the leaders of an Islamist terrorist organization.\" Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said the warrants being issues was absurd.\n\nCountries across the Middle East also praised and backed the court, as did South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.

It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister takes the stand as a criminal defendant, an embarrassing milestone for a leader who has tried to cultivate an image as a sophisticated and respected statesman.\n\nUpon starting his testimony, Netanyahu said \"hello\" to the judges. One judge told him he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose.\n\n\"I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,\" Netanyahu said, standing at a podium in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom. He called the charges against him \"an ocean of absurdness\" and promised his version would cut through the prosecution's case.\n\nNetanyahu appeared at ease as he began telling his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges' perception of him. He said he used to lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing -- in contrast to the prosecution's attempts to paint him as image-obsessed.\n\nHe said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, but hated champagne. One case revolves around him receiving a \"supply line\" of cigars and champagne from billionaire associates.\n\nHis lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he can continue running the country.\n\nNetanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.\n\nHe is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family.\n\nNetanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family.\n\nThe testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu's working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria.\n\nNetanyahu, in his testimony, said he could \"find a balance\" between both commitments.\n\nDozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \"Crime Minister.\"\n\nUnder Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. He overcame the political tumult only two years ago by striking an agreement with smaller right-wing parties that had long languished on the edges of Israeli politics, to form the country's most far-right government ever.\n\nNetanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system's bias and overreach, while his opponents have accused him of prolonging the raging war in Gaza in a bid to distract from, if not delay his own court proceedings. Netanyahu launched the war on Gaza's Hamas rulers immediately after they carried out their brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.\n\nDespite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.\n\nAn Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister's busy schedule and the country's significant challenges. A verdict isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court has spent months hearing prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu's once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception.\n\nThe most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.\n\nNetanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.\n\nMoreover, the prime minister is accused of accepting nearly $200,000 in champagne and cigars from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and in exchange, he allegedly operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.\n\nNetanyahu's testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time for Israel's longest-serving leader. His popular support dropped after the Hamas attack in October 2023, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today polls suggest he would struggle to form another new government.\n\nIsrael is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages still held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home.\n\nThe Israeli leader, along with his former defense minister, also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza, which his office has dismissed as \"absurd and false actions and charges.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/10/c906ffa3-4266-4f95-b816-c04e9870a015/thumbnail/1200x630/55a8283e1d8e4def62768c8743f75ab9/netanyahu-corruption-trial-2188597367.jpg?v=d633d0331cc96a4353754b3de830df72", "eventUri": "eng-10154064", "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 62, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8463767348", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-18", "time": "18:03:46", "dateTime": "2024-12-18T18:03:46Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-18T18:02:45Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2024/12/18/oil-rich-iran-short-of-fuel-electricity-billions-spent-on-terror/", "title": "Oil-rich Iran Short of Fuel, Electricity; Billions Spent on Terror", "body": "Iran is in the midst of a fuel shortage and an electricity crisis, causing essential utilities to be shut down in the middle of a cold winter.

Successive years have seen Jewish rioters target Palestinian locals whose movement in the city is further restricted by the IDF to secure the area for the pilgrims.\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the attempted attack on Bluth from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Defense Minister Israel Katz, the latter of whom earlier Friday announced an end to administrative detention orders for West Bank settlers, meaning Israel will now be using the controversial policy of holding suspects without charge only against Palestinian terror suspects.\n\nThe Shin Bet had reportedly warned against the move, with the security agency's chief Ronen Bar saying in June that banning the measure against Israelis \"will result in an immediate, severe and serious harm to the security of the state\" in cases where there is clear information that a suspect may carry out a terror attack.\n\nAdministrative detention policies allow the Defense Ministry to hold suspects without charge, while administrative restraining orders bar them from visiting certain areas or communicating with certain people. The tool is typically used when authorities have intelligence tying a suspect to a crime but do not have enough evidence for charges to stand up in a court of law.\n\nSettler violence has spiked since the October 7, 2023, Hamas onslaught in the south. Israeli authorities rarely arrest Jewish perpetrators in such attacks. Some rights groups lament that convictions are even more unusual and that the vast majority of charges in these types of attacks are dropped.\n\nBluth pledged \"not [to] blink\" in the face of settler violence when he took over in June as head of IDF Central Command, which oversees the West Bank. His successor, Maj. Gen. Yehuda Fox, said at the time that while \"the vast majority\" of Israeli settlers in the West Bank are \"moral, law-abiding citizens,\" some were \"adopting the ways of the enemy\" and settler leaders weren't denouncing this violence.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/11/F240708OBH05-e1732319024799.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10112099", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 58, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8447813612", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-08", "time": "11:01:37", "dateTime": "2024-12-08T11:01:37Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-08T11:01:28Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/12/08/us-news/unhinged-man-dubbed-macnazi-waging-war-on-upper-west-side-jews/", "title": "Exclusive | Unhinged man dubbed 'MackNazi' terrorizing NYC, ripping down Israeli...", "body": "An unhinged, Israel-hating dog walker who lives with his TV-actress sister on the Upper West Side is terrorizing the neighborhood, repeatedly ripping down Israeli hostage posters and allegedly assaulting anyone who dares get in his way, The Post has learned.\n\nSince Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, Mackenzie Watson - dubbed \"MackNazi\" by many of his neighbors -- has waged a one-man war on anyone posting hostage flyers or removing pro-Palestine stickers, according to court records and some of his alleged victims.\n\n\"He really just hates Jews,\" said a 48-year-old resident who's watched Watson's antics and estimated at least 100 Upper West Siders \"have had bad run-ins with him.\"\n\nShe also said Watson -- who lives in the nabe with his 29-year-old sister Jamie Linn Watson, who's appeared in FX's \"What We Do in the Shadows\" and the Judd Apatow flick \"Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy\" -- seems more worried about ripping down posters than caring for the pooches he walks.\n\n\"He'll sometimes have four dogs; they're hooked to his waist, and he's using both hands at the same time to just pull off the stickers at every corner,\" the woman added.\n\nWatson's most recent outbursts include a June incident where he tailed and harassed a 15-year-old girl and her mom, 56, after the teen ripped off one his \"antisemitic\" stop-genocide stickers from a lamp post on the corner of West 103rd Street and West End Avenue, the fearful mother recalled.\n\nWatson then shoved his phone camera in their faces before stalking them for five blocks as they tried to flee him, she said.\n\n\"I don't give a s-t about the hostages, and I don't give a shit about the thousands of dead babies,\" the mom recalled Watson screaming. \"F-k you, piece of s-t!

But the most palpable sentiment was one of unity.\n\n\"I think it's terrible. What about Putin? What about the real evil people?\" Sarita Katzin Sarfati said about the court's decision to call for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes committed in Gaza after the October 7 attack on Israel last year.\n\n\"Netanyahu is thinking about his people... and I think that all the world should support us and Bibi is our prime minister, and they should support Bibi as well,\" Sarita told CNN, using the Israeli nickname for Netanyahu.\n\nAs shoppers rushed through the narrow alleyways of the market, Netanel Yehuda told CNN he too was outraged.\n\n\"I'm against it. We're a nation, we are independent, and we can take our own decision here. Nobody else can tell us to put someone in jail or anything else,\" he said.\n\nThat sentiment is shared by many in Israel, according to experts.\n\nGil Siegal, a legal scholar at the Ono Academic College in Israel, said The Hague-based court's decision has united Israelis.\n\n\"Israelis come together when under pressure,\" he told CNN. \"We can disagree because we think Netanyahu should do A over B, fine, but when the outer world is coming to get us, so to speak... this external pressure is a uniting force, not a breaking force,\" he said.\n\nMost Israelis still support the war in Gaza, he said, seeing it as a just fight and the only means to keep their country safe. And while many oppose Netanyahu - mass protests calling for his resignation are now happening weekly - most feel he has been targeted unfairly by the ICC.\n\nThe limited opposition to the war is motivated by the rising death toll of Israeli soldiers in Gaza and the hope that a ceasefire would secure the release of the 101 hostages still held there, with the suffering of Palestinians largely absent from the anti-war discourse.\n\nThis is partly because the shock of the brutal October 7 terror attack, during which Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people, is still raw in the country. Many Israelis know someone who was directly impacted by the attack and most have family members or friends who are currently fighting in Gaza or are serving in the military in another capacity.\n\nPortraits of the hostages are on display across Israel, along the sea promenade in Tel Aviv and in the arrivals hall at the country's airport.\n\nSome Israelis are also outraged that the ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant alongside one for Mohammed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, the Hamas leader who Israel claims was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack.\n\nThe ICC \"is saying that Gallant and Netanyahu are equal to Mohammed Deif... this is something that Israelis truly cannot comprehend, truly, truly cannot comprehend,\" Siegal said.\n\nYael Vias Gvirsman represents the families of hundreds of Israeli victims of the October 7 attacks at the ICC and was in The Hague on Thursday when the warrants were issued. She said the warrant against Deif was an important recognition \"that Hamas attacks consisted of extermination, torture, rape and other sexual crimes and inhumane treatment\" and that it was good news for families she represents. \"It's the first step for recognition and the first step for them rebuilding their lives,\" she said.\n\nBut she added that the simultaneous warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant were understandably met with \"great shock\" in Israel, \"because it is a nation at its most difficult hour.\"\n\nThe court said it found \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including \"starvation as a method of warfare\" and \"the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\"\n\nMore than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7 last year, according to the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu denounced the ICC move on Thursday, calling it an \"antisemitic decision\" and \"a modern Dreyfus trial,\" referring to the 1894 wrongful conviction of Jewish-French soldier Alfred Dreyfus, an affair that has since come to symbolize antisemitic persecution.\n\nThe prime minister said the ICC judges were \"motivated by antisemitic sentiments against the one and only Jewish state.\"\n\nMeanwhile, opposition leader Yair Lapid called the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant a \"reward for terrorism.\"\n\nImplications for soldiers fighting in Gaza\n\nWhile the ICC arrest warrants target only Netanyahu and Gallant, some are worried about the implications for the Israel Defense Forces and its soldiers.\n\nConscription is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis and some 300,000 reservists have been called up because of the war, on top of the estimated 170,000 active-duty soldiers.\n\nThe right-wing Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin has warned about the arrest warrants \"creating a dangerous precedent for the ICC to target other democratic armies and leaders.\" The group has long warned about the ICC possibly opening a criminal investigation against Israeli soldiers.\n\nLegal action at the ICC against Israeli soldiers, it said on its website, would \"carry devastating effects\" on Israel, and cause immediate personal risk to individuals \"whose only blame is for serving their country and fighting terror.\"\n\nRefusals by potential recruits and reservists to serve are rare in Israel, but there are signs that they have been increasing amid the global outrage over the toll of the war in Gaza. Taking an unusually public stance, a group of more than 130 Israeli reservists signed an open letter to Netanyahu and Gallant last month, stating that they refuse to serve unless a deal is signed to end the war and bring back the hostages, saying that for some of them \"the red line has already been crossed.\"\n\nSoul Behar Tsalik, an Israeli who intends to refuse his mandatory enlistment in the IDF next week, said the ICC warrant strengthens his commitment to refuse.\n\n\"Israel's war machine does not only destroy Gaza but also hurts Israelis - in body and in spirit,\" he told CNN. \"I hope the ICC's ruling will help make a change, will make my fellow Israelis realize the truth and severity of the claims against our leaders, and push Israel to leave Gaza, free the hostages and end the occupation as soon as possible.\"\n\nBreaking the Silence, an organization of Israeli veterans who oppose the war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, was a rare voice of support for the ICC's decision.\n\nIt said in a statement that the \"flood of condemnations, an array of whataboutisms and countless allegations of antisemitism\" was indicative of the Israeli \"society's insistence, even now, to not see what we are doing in Gaza.\"\n\nCNN's Michael Schwartz and Kareem Khadder contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivana_kottasova@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Ivana Kottasov\u00e1", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-26t155038z-1712627661-rc2656a73s4j-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-netanyahu.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri": "eng-10105884", "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 56, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8451745351", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-10", "time": "22:24:54", "dateTime": "2024-12-10T22:24:54Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-10T22:24:23Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "url": "https://www.skynews.com.au/insights-and-analysis/israeli-deputy-minister-of-foreign-affairs-urges-albanese-govt-to-find-its-voice-in-stamping-out-the-scourge-of-antisemitism/news-story/28a1e19624ef65a971565b81bba60fbc", "title": "Albanese govt urged to 'find its voice in stamping out the scourge of antisemitism'", "body": "Of all the terrible incidents of grotesque antisemitism we have seen around the world since the barbaric massacre in Israel by Hamas on October 7 2023, it is the terror attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne which is the most personally confronting for me.\n\nI spent almost seven wonderful years of my life living in Australia, and despite being born in Canada, Australia is my second home after Israel.\n\nI moved to Australia in 2007 after serving in the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) during the Second Intifada.\n\nI worked as a veterinary nurse in Bondi and made my home in Sydney - truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\n\nLike so many immigrants to your country, I found Australia overwhelmingly welcoming, open, tolerant and free.\n\nAustralia is one of the most successful multicultural nations anywhere in the world, but since October 7, all this has changed.\n\nJew-hate has exploded in Australia; what has happened to the loving, welcoming Australia that made me so happy all those years ago?\n\nThe largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has unleashed a torrent of antisemitism in Australia that I never knew existed, and that state and federal governments have clearly failed to adequately deal with.\n\nOn October 8 2023, Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud addressed a protest organised by Hizb ut-Tahrir, delighting in the murder of Jews.\n\nHe said: \"I'm elated. It's a day of courage, it's a day of resistance, it's a day of pride, it's a day of victory.\"\n\nOn October 9 2023, outside the Sydney Opera House, a pro-Hamas mob shouted \"F*** the Jews!\" and \"Where's the Jews?\"\n\nHave any of these people been prosecuted for this hate speech and intimidation towards Jews, no.\n\nJewish students don't feel safe on university campuses around Australia anymore, and a Jewish academic had his office invaded.\n\n\"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" isn't just a chant, it's calling for the destruction of the State of Israel and the slaughter of Jews.\n\nWhy can't university officials understand this and stop the hate directed towards Jewish students?\n\nNear where I used to live in Sydney, cars and other property were recently set alight and then defaced with the most horrific antisemitic messages.\n\nThere was a confrontation between Jews and pro-Palestinian protesters outside the synagogue in Caulfield of my friend Rabbi Daniel Rabin.\n\nAnti-Israel protesters descended on a synagogue in Melbourne in November last year after Jews were falsely accused of arson.\n\nThere have been several other shocking incidents where Jewish Australians have been pelted with rocks, shoes and eggs.\n\nSome have been spat at, one had a can of drink thrown at him, and many have been abused in the street.\n\nEarlier this year \"a 77-year-old Jewish woman was spat on, threatened and kicked multiple times, by protesters opposing a rally to counter antisemitism, outside the Victorian Parliament House\".\n\nThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) has done some important work tracking the increase in Jew hate incidents in Australia since October 7.\n\nECAJ Research Director Julie Nathan found that from October 1 2023 to September 30 2024, there were 2,062 anti-Jewish incidents.\n\n\"In the previous 12-month period, ending 30 September 2023, these same bodies logged 495 incidents. Accordingly, there was an increase of 316 per cent in the overall number of reported anti- Jewish incidents compared to the previous year,\" a report stated.\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. The Australian government must do more to combat extreme Jew hate but as Julie Nathan said in her report, \"the response from political and community leaders, university executives and civil society has been tepid at best\".\n\nAs Federal Court Judge Justice Michael Lee recently said in a powerful speech, since October 7 there is a \"stark and discomforting realisation that despite living our whole lives in this country, and thinking we knew it so well, we do not now recognise an aspect of it\".\n\nHe also observed that \"the growth and mainstreaming of antisemitism we have all seen emerge over the last 13 months must be tackled, but understanding how it is to be tackled requires some understanding of how we got to where we are\".\n\nMore leadership is required from the Australian government.\n\nThey have pandered to the anti-Jew mob since October 7 by banning a former Israeli Minister from entering Australia. Ayelet Shaked has similar views to me, will I be banned from Australia too?\n\nThe Australian government is now voting against Israel at the UN.\n\nDoes it surprise anyone that as Justice Lee said, antisemitism is being 'mainstreamed' in Australia when the government says that there should be a Palestinian state without requiring them to recognise our right to exist first, and to release the 101 hostages still held captive by Hamas monster?\n\nAt the time of writing, the perpetrators of the terrorist attack on Adass Israel Synagogue are still at large.\n\nI hope those responsible are caught, prosecuted and severely punished.\n\nAustralia was one of the first nations to vote to support the State of Israel at the UN, we hope we can rely on Australia's support again soon.\n\nAustralia is one of the world's great democracies and multicultural nations.\n\nI just hope the Australian government can find its voice in stamping out the scourge of antisemitism domestically, and to support democracies wherever they are imperilled, like Israel.\n\nIsrael is fighting for its survival against the murderous proxies of Iran who embody the very antithesis of Australian values - it's high time the Australian government recognised this fact and acted accordingly.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3c96e09c862ce0131d07e3c6d6b6fc99", "eventUri": "eng-10158467", "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 49, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8443434174", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-05", "time": "09:51:15", "dateTime": "2024-12-05T09:51:15Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-05T09:51:02Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1628969-afe-babalola-dele-farotimis-arrest-wasnt-alleged-defamation-lawyer-speaks/", "title": "Afe Babalola: 'Dele Farotimi's arrest wasn't on alleged defamation', lawyer speaks", "body": "PAY ATTENTION: Follow our WhatsApp channel to never miss out on the news that matters to you!\n\nLegit.ng journalist, Ridwan Adeola Yusuf, has over 9 years of experience covering public affairs.\n\nAdo Ekiti, Eikit state - Muhammed Ndakudu Adam, a lawyer, has said technically, the arrest of Dele Farotimi was not on alleged defamation but on refusal to appear in court to defend the alleged defamation.\n\nLegit.ng had reported how a chief magistrate's court in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital, on Wednesday, December 4, remanded Farotimi, a 'retired' lawyer and activist in prison over alleged defamation of Afe Babalola, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and founder of Afe Babalola University Ado Ekiti (ABUAD).\n\nFarotimi was seized at an office in Lagos and transported to Ekiti state.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, December 3, the opposition figure, who is vocal on social media, raised an alarm.

Does it indicate they are planning a false flag event?", "body": "After all London's webcams went dark on Monday, 25 November, Alex Krainer wonders if a false flag attack is being planned on London.\n\nHe suggests that a false flag attack on London may be planned by Western powers to blame on Russia, triggering a whole-of-society mobilisation against Russia. Why, what would they have to gain? Krainer suggests that the Western powers' goal is to maintain their dominance over the Eurasian landmass.\n\nTo complement Krainer's hypothesis, we have added a video released by filmmaker Chris Todd Nolan. Using a series of documentaries he released 7 years ago, Nolan summarises how the Ukraine war really began.\n\nBy Alex Krainer, 27 November 2024\n\nYesterday, as I was finalising my new report about the financial collapse of Great Britain, which is the follow-up to my 26 August article 'The Coming Collapse of Britain', YouTube randomly suggested to me a short video by one Craig Houston titled, 'Why are ALL LONDON webcams offline...?'\n\nWhat? Did I read that right??? I was nearly floored.\n\nMr. Houston searched hundreds of Webcams across London and could not find a single one that was live. See for yourself HERE and HERE! That's extremely odd; clearly, someone had to have made the decision to switch them off - they couldn't all have failed for random reasons.\n\nOne of the webcams over Westminster Bridge displayed the last image it recorded: it was on 2 September at 16:51, which at least gives us a clue about when the Heart of Darkness went dark to the world. However, the reason why someone would decide to cut all the webcams is a mystery.\n\nMr. Houston didn't offer any explanations, which is understandable given that he lives in Britain where singing, \"kung fu fighting,\" or silently praying on the sidewalk can get you arrested. But where he declined to tread, I'll venture a guess, and I think it's the only explanation that makes any sense: they're planning a false-flag terror attack on London which they'll blame on Russia, so that they can trigger an all-out, whole-of-society mobilisation by all of the Western powers against Russia. Now, if this seems far-fetched, there are now several important elements that fit coherently with this scenario, starting with the general geopolitical state of things.\n\nWestern empire and in particular the UK, bet heavily on Ukraine and lost. By now the situation has become as undeniable as it is hopeless. But Western powers aren't showing any inclination to cut and run, like they did from Vietnam in March of 1972 or Afghanistan in August 2021. In spite of facing the world's largest nuclear power with established escalatory dominance in the region and a mobilised, highly trained, motivated and battle-hardened army equipped with devastating conventional weaponry that eclipses anything the West has in its depleted arsenals, they are still escalating. Why?\n\nUkraine is too important and the stakes could not be higher. From the imperial cabal's point of view, the stake is the whole world. In his paper, 'Democratic Ideals and Reality', Sir Halford Mackinder wrote that, \"Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World-island; who rules the World-island controls the world.\" By World-island, Mackinder meant the Eurasian landmass.\n\nHis theoretical framework remained the foundation of foreign policy for British and American governments to this very day, as we learned from Wes Mitchell, Donald Trump's Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs as recently as 2018. In a briefing to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he made it explicit that the \"central aim of the Administration's foreign policy is to defend US domination of Eurasian landmass as the foremost US national security interest and to prepare the nation for this challenge.\"\n\nMitchell also said that the Administration was \"working with our close ally the UK to form an international coalition for coordinating efforts in this field.\" These views are not just idle musings of think tanks or academics; the reality on the ground confirms that this is indeed how the imperial cabal regards the outcome of the battle for Ukraine. From the beginning of the war, a few of their lieutenants vented the mindset:\n\nIt is unlikely that the empire's vested interests will quietly accept this \"catastrophe.\" This is why they are escalating provocations against Russia, desperately hoping that the Russians will strike at a NATO member nation, creating the pretext to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and unleash a unified response where the collective West would confront Russia in a whole-of-society mobilisation effort and hopefully snatch a victory out of the jaws of defeat.\n\nSometimes provocations work and they trigger the intended response. An example was the Pearl Harbour attack, which galvanised the unwilling Americans to join the World War II effort. Another was the attack on RMS Lusitania in 1915, and another the current Ukraine war. But there are circumstances when a galvanising event must be orchestrated to detonate the greater conflict, and the list of known examples through history is very long. Here are just a few cases:\n\nThe examples are very numerous and another one, aimed at triggering World War III against Russia wouldn't be unusual in the context of history. If the population are taken by surprise and genuinely believes the official narratives about the attack, this does invariably create the \"helpful waves of indignation,\" allowing the country's leadership to wrap themselves in the flag, promise justice whatever the cost, and start moving the pieces irreversibly toward military escalation.\n\nI believe that this is the reason why Western powers are encouraging Ukraine to strike into Russia with their missiles, even though there is almost nothing to gain and such escalation clearly makes them the belligerents in the conflict. This is why suddenly, the US is discussing providing Ukraine with nuclear Weapons. They want Russia to respond impulsively, but they know Russia most probably won't take the bait. That's where the false flag comes in, probably in the shape of the detonation of a nuclear weapon in London.\n\nI can't imagine how this could be done. I imagine there's very tight custody chain control with every warhead warehoused by any Western power. But if such weapons were given to Ukraine, that's where the custody chain would end. From there, the warheads could be free to roam and drift back to serve false flag purposes, perhaps on routine military flights, or in ordinary shipping containers. If such a device were detonated from a shipping container, say, on a ship, a train or a truck, some Webcam might catch the event.\n\nBut if all the Webcams were dark, the news could report that it was a Russian missile. And it would be very unlikely that anybody could ever prove otherwise. If such images ever did surface, they'd almost certainly be few and they could be quickly traced and removed from circulation. If there's another coherent explanation for why all of London's Webcams went dark in early September, I can't even begin to imagine it.\n\nTomorrow is Thanksgiving and I considered not sharing the above musings today. For one thing, I could be wrong - that much is obvious. And then it's a downer - nothing to be thankful for. But if I happen to be right ... The one way false flag events can fail is if the public sees through them. False flag attack planners must ambush the people and strike at them from the clear blue skies. A spectacular event like 9/11 will have a powerful impact on people's emotions and in that moment, they'll be susceptible to deceptive narratives and that \"helpful wave of indignation\" will materialise. But if the public is forewarned and expects that a false flag might take place, they'll almost certainly suspect that it was \"an inside job,\" and the attack might blow back into the conspirators' faces. I have therefore decided to take risks with my American readers' long weekend and to also risk embarrassing myself.\n\nIn the thick of the covid-19 pandemic, Dr. Mike Yeadon - one of the true scientists who saw through the hoax and did not fear to speak out about it, said that this is the time to be brave. He wasn't saying that we should go out and tackle police officers or charge against tanks with Molotov cocktails. He was talking about taking the risk of being wrong, of embarrassing oneself. It is easier and safer to be silent about all this.\n\nBut we need to be brave and speak out like our children's future depends on it. Alex Jones predicted the 9/11 attack weeks ahead of time, but back then, his warning sounded so utterly crazy and preposterous that nobody would risk discrediting themselves by sharing Alex's bombshell. In fact, few would even admit to listening to Jones. Few still do. But then again ... if he was wrong, so what? If I'm wrong, nothing happens. If I'm right, however, this information could change history.\n\nI'm not an American citizen, but my children are, so I'll allow myself to do the American thing today and express my profound gratitude for all the subscribers who read these reports which, like today, verge on excessively long. You all came for the signals but I kept you for the sermon. Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nAlex Krainer is the founder of Krainer Analytics and creator of I-System Trend Following.

In 2024 there is no security: The public simply operates on blind faith that no one will take advantage of the vast weaknesses built into the system and government officials hide any risks associated with their policies.\n\nBut what are the sources of the danger headed our way? Why is 2025 becoming more and more prominent as an inception date for an attack?\n\nDonald Trump's election win, his impending return to the White House and his promise to close the border and deport millions of illegals could be the cleansing tsunami that America needs, but it could also inversely trigger a host of foreign attacks, domestic attacks as well as false flag events.\n\nHere are the reasons why the next year is ripe for a large scale event...\n\n\"Homeland Security\" is a misnomer; the current head of DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas, openly admitted to a room full of border patrol agents this year that over 85% of illegal immigrants apprehended at the southern border are released into the country. Mayorkas originally claimed the release rate was 70% in an interview with FOX News, only to raise that number to 85% when agents pressed him during the private meeting.\n\nReports indicate that at least 400,000 known criminals have crossed the border illegally during Joe Biden's presidency, and 13,000 of those immigrants were convicted murderers. What we don't know, however, is how many terror suspects and foreign agents have also entered the US in the past four years.\n\nThe DHS releases limited data. Migrants that get a hit on the terror watch list are held and cataloged, of course, but with wide open borders and the Biden White House running interference there's no way to know how many slipped through.\n\nThe political left argues that \"no terror attacks have happened on Biden's watch\", but these are the same people that originally denied the existence of Venezuelan gangs taking over apartment complexes in multiple cities across the country. The saturation of illegal migrants will inevitably lead to a terror event in America, it's only a matter of time. Why? Because now they are under threat of being removed en masse.\n\nWhatever their original plans, the reality of mass deportation puts these people on a time table and some may act out violently in response. Many will feel entitled to stay in the US despite their criminal entry.\n\nIt may not happen on Biden's watch, but his administration will have been the catalyst that made deportations necessary and the resulting attacks possible.\n\nI believe an attack is inevitable in 2025 primarily because of the geopolitical brush fires being ignited across the globe right now. There is also always the looming danger of false flag events designed by covert actors trying to trick the public into placing blame on the wrong culprit.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the expanding wars in the Middle East involving Israel (and the resurgence in Syria) are dependent on US support and possibly future military involvement on the ground. It's fair to say that without US involvement, all of these wars would end rather quickly. One can debate the ethical necessity of America engaging in proxy conflicts or the need for the US to protect certain allies and assets, but a lot of foreign elements view the US as the root cause of their pain.\n\nThey also know the easiest way to attack the US is through the doorway that the current establishment has left wide open on the southern border.\n\nThe US has been hit with a mass immigration storm while also embroiled in at least two regional proxy wars that have the potential to expand into world wars. Why wouldn't Russia, China, or multiple nations in the Middle East use that weakness to their advantage? Even more disturbing, the globalists that want the US to send troops to defend Ukraine or Israel could also perpetrate an attack that falsely leads back to Russia or Iran.\n\nI continue to argue that America has no reason to be involved in the majority of foreign entanglements and that we should stay out of these conflicts entirely. But we are where we are. There are malicious people within our own government that want to force Americans into war, and there are foreign actors that hate us because of the actions of these same elites. The dominoes have already been set in motion and guess where that leaves us?\n\nThe conservative sweep on election day means we inherit all the messes that Joe Biden and his handlers created - Economic, political, social, and geopolitical. There will also be considerable motivation for establishment elites to create chaos from thin air while conservatives hold governmental power, and this presents a third domestic threat which will definitely arise in the wake of a Trump presidency: Leftist activists.\n\nThe goal of the progressive establishment when it comes to attacking conservatives is to create so much instability and fear that conservatives feel compelled to set aside their principles and the constitution in order to restore order. In this way the left hopes to \"prove\" that conservatives are the \"fascists\" they often accuse us of being.\n\nFor the past several years conservatives have also been labeled \"domestic terrorists\" bent on civil war, but it's actually the progressive left that engages in the majority of civil unrest and violence in the name of political expediency.\n\nThe first time leftists were enraged by a political loss and took to the streets to riot, most conservatives and even the Trump administration erred on the side of constitutional flexibility. The problem is, leftists have a habit of exploiting free speech rights as a springboard for mob intimidation. Also, most of the riots took place in Democrat controlled states and cities where local officials defended the violence and tried to block any intervention.\n\nSome people argue that leftists are no longer motivated to engage in this kind of unrest and the lack of chaos after Trump's election win is proof. I beg to differ. First, leftists are not a hardy bunch and they tend to wait for warmer weather before going out to cause disruption. Second, Trump isn't even in office yet. Just wait until the mass deportations start and then you'll see all kinds of riots.\n\nThe political left believes that mob violence and looting is a form of free speech and \"reparations\" for perceived injustices. They feel completely justified in their behavior and that makes them exceedingly dangerous. If you see the mass burning of random neighborhoods as an \"ends justify the means\" situation, then you can probably convince yourself that any crime is acceptable.\n\nThis trend of terrorism as activism is likely to evolve beyond simple mobs in the next round. In other words, under a new Trump Administration we should expect smaller Weather Underground-like groups among progressive activists; groups that will engage in terror attacks. The two assassination attempts against Trump this year support this hypothesis.\n\nTo summarize, there are four distinct instigators of political violence all active going into 2025:\n\nThe types of attacks we face comprise a wide spectrum and I fear that conservatives may very well throw support behind a martial law scenario should the situation break out the way I think it will. Infrastructure attacks would be the most devastating (and would not require a high level of effort or sophistication); a lot of people may see military intervention as the best option.\n\nI would argue that this is exactly what the establishment wants. They want the liberty movement to abandon our foundations in the name of security - They want us to take shortcuts that lead us down an authoritarian path. If we are to increase the safety of the American populace it's going to take years of work to fix the mess that progressives have left behind. No shortcuts like martial law.\n\nWe'll have to close the borders tight (The one place where a national guard or military presence makes sense). We'll have to deport millions of illegal migrants already in the country. We'll have to reduce our presence in global proxy wars. We'll have to secure communities through localized efforts (militias).\n\nMost importantly, should violence break out, community participation in defense is paramount. The locals need to be prepared for grid down, for rioting, for random attacks. It's the general public that needs to be ready. Regular civilians are the people that will be there the moment disaster strikes and they must be empowered to take action.\n\nWhen a terror attack takes minutes to achieve, regular people who are there when it occurs have seconds to respond. Until we can repair the damage done to our national security over the past four years, the public is the first and most important line of defense.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-12/border-Open1-768x448.jpg?itok=W-x4DmeK", "eventUri": "eng-10147968", "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 46, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8452578059", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-11", "time": "11:21:25", "dateTime": "2024-12-11T11:21:25Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-11T11:21:13Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/12/11/world-news/kibbutz-nir-oz-survivor-wants-to-return-home-despite-trauma/", "title": "Hamas terrorists burned down her kibbutz, killed her husband and dog...", "body": "KIBBUTZ NIR OZ, Israel -- Liat Atzili lost nearly everything on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists rampaged through this kibbutz less than two miles from the Gaza border fence.\n\nTerrorists murdered her husband Aviv Atzili and their dog Revy. They ransacked and burned her home and carried her off as a hostage.\n\nBut Atzili said she's determined to return home to the kibbutz -- despite the devastation and its proximity to the Gaza Strip.\n\nThirty-eight residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed and 75 were kidnapped in the attack. In all, one in four residents was either murdered or taken hostage -- leaving the kibbutz as one of the most devastated communities following the terror attack.\n\n\"I believe that that it's really, really important to bring this place back to life.

Atzili figures that it will be at least a year before they can even start rebuilding.\n\nAtzili and other displaced residents of the kibbutz have been living together about 40 miles north in Kiryat Gat. Some of the remaining survivors do not want to return to the beautiful small kibbutz, which is home to a botanical garden and several roaming peacocks.\n\nThey feel the tragedy can never be erased from the village regardless of the amount of new construction -- but they're not yet sure where their new home will be.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in the community who aren't interested in coming back and sort of they haven't been given a civil solution to where they're going to be living in the long term,\" Atzili said.\n\nResidents of the kibbutz earlier had agreed not to take action on the demolitions and rebuilding until after the first anniversary of the attack.\n\nThere are some houses whose fates the kibbutz has not decided, including the home of the Siman Tov family -- all of whom Hamas slaughtered as they huddled together in their safe room.\n\nTheir home remains standing, albeit with the tiled roof caving in. Inside, a few remnants remain of their lives there -- including a metal menorah in a destroyed window sill and children's toys in the front yard. The saferoom where they died still stands, although it is pitch black with smoke and fire damage.\n\n\"Something happened to everybody from the family. Yonatan and Tamar and were shot through the door of their safe room, and they died from their wounds,\" she said. \"Their three children and suffocated from inhaling smoke when the house was set on fire.\"\n\nThe community is internally discussing whether to clean up and leave the home standing as a memorial to the devastating loss, while others do not want the stark reminder of the hell that took place a little more than a year ago, Atzili said.\n\n\"A lot of people know the story and want to see the house,\" Atzili said.\n\nFor Atzili, it is important to return to the community that her husband died trying to protect.

of my life,\" Ms Allan said.\n\n\"I'll never forget the harrowing stories of those who had escaped from that act of terror.\n\n\"There are too many who want to qualify anti-Semitism or make excuses for it, and I want to make it absolutely clear that I never will.\"\n\nUnder the planned changes announced on Tuesday, the government would introduce laws which it said would more strongly protect the right of people to attend places of worship.\n\nThe changes could include the establishment of safe access areas around places of religious worship to outlaw protests.\n\nMs Allan said the changes would safeguard Victoria's multiculturalism, which was \"the solution\" to social cohesion issues.\n\n\"A modern, multicultural Victoria is one that is built on a simple promise: whoever you are, whoever you pray to, you are safe and welcome in this state,\" she said.\n\nThe premier also announced additional measures to build social cohesion in the state, which she said had clearly deteriorated in recent months.\n\nThe government plans introduce a \"social cohesion pledge\" for multicultural organisations, that must be observed in order to access government grants.\n\nThe proposed legislation will need to pass parliament, and would be formed in discussion with religion leaders and communities.\n\nIt comes as the NSW government vows to make similar law changes, following a rally outside Sydney's Great Synagogue on December 4.\n\nThe government has also earmarked the formation of a new 'Local Escalation and Help' group including representatives of Jewish community groups to liaise directly with government.\n\nProtesters face ban on masks, locks and glue\n\nA separate set of measures were also announced by Ms Allan to deliver greater powers to police when responding to public protests.\n\nUnder the changes, the government would introduce its own state ban on protester use of terror organisation flags, as well as face masks and balaclavas.\n\nWhile acknowledging not all protesters using masks were anti-Semitic, Ms Allan said face coverings had been used by bad actors at protests.\n\n\"We know they are being used to conceal identities, shield agitators from crowd control measures,\" Ms Allan said.\n\nGlue, ropes and locks would also be banned at protests, with the government highlighting protest groups who have used the tools to attach themselves to public spaces.\n\nMs Allan said while the right to protest was important, it would not trump the safety of Victorians.\n\n\"Peaceful protests can and must be protected in this state, protests that harm others cannot,\" Ms Allan said.\n\nPolice given new powers around protests\n\nMinister for Police Anthony Carbines said these new laws would provide an opportunity for Victoria Police to protesters to remove face covering at rallies.\n\n\"Ski-masks are for Mt Buller in the ski seasons, they are not for streets in Melbourne,\" Mr Carbines said.\n\n\"If you stand for something, you don't get to hide behind a mask here in Victoria.\"\n\nMr Carbines said the new laws would mean if a protester refused to remove their face coverings, they could be arrested and charged.\n\nHe said the outlawing of \"attachment devices\" was made in an effort to help emergency services, who faced risks when responding to protesters who used them.\n\nPolice would also be given the power to stop and search people or their vehicles if they suspect they have a dangerous attachment device.\n\nUnder the current law, the government said police had to return such devices to \"offenders\".\n\nUnder the proposed changes, police would be able to seize, remove and destroy the devices.\n\n\"We know that attachment devices that people put first responders at risk in both removing offenders and making a situation safe, they disrupt the economy, they disrupt people from going about their lawful activities,\" Mr Carbines said.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au",

the Gaza Strip, Israel's military said Monday.\n\nOmer Neutra, a 21-year-old New York native, who served as a tank platoon commander after emigrating to Israel, was killed in battle and kidnapped, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on X, as he paid tribute to the fallen soldier.\n\n\"Omer's life story and dedication represent the best and strongest we have built as a nation,\" he said in a post on X. He added that Neutra fell in battle in Nir Oz, a kibbutz less than two miles from the fenced-off border with Gaza and one of the areas hit hardest when Hamas militants stormed through southern Israel.\n\nHowever, the military did not say how it came to the conclusion over Neutra's death. It added that he had been posthumously promoted to the rank of captain.\n\nAround 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas' terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that also saw 1,200 people killed, according to Israeli tallies. Around 100 people remain in captivity, although a third are believed to be dead.\n\nNeutra was born and raised in the U.S., before he emigrated to Israel as a lone soldier and enlisted in the Armored Corps, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group for those held captive and their families.\n\nIn a statement released today, it said his body was still being held captive by Hamas.\n\nNeutra is survived by his parents, Ronen and Orna, and his brother, Daniel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended his \"heartfelt condolences\" to the family. \"We share in the family's heavy grief,\" he said in a statement, adding, \"We will continue to act resolutely and tirelessly until we return all of our captives -- the living and the dead.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who met with Omer's parents in March, also offered condolences to Neutra's family. \"We pray that his body can be returned to his family who have been speaking out for him & all hostages since that horrific day,\" she said in a post on X.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News' \"TODAY\" in September, Neutra's parents called for a ceasefire and hostage-release deal with Hamas.\n\n\"We basically ask ourselves every morning, 'What are we doing today to try and bring him out?'\" Ronen said, adding that it was \"critical that people do not forget\" the hostages.\n\nNews of Neutra's death came just two days after the mother of Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander told NBC News she was both shaken and relieved to see her son in a Hamas-issued propaganda video.\n\n\"To get this video it's a huge relief for me to see that he's still strong. It was amazing,\" Yael Alexander said in a video call Saturday, hours after the video, captioned \"time is running out,\" was posted on the Telegram channel of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who appears under duress in the Hamas video, calls on President-elect Donald Trump to use his power to negotiate for the freedom of those who remain in captivity in Gaza.\n\nWhile a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group appeared to be holding, there have been few signs of progress in talks to secure a release of the remaining hostages or a cessation of fighting with Hamas in Gaza, where more than 44,000 have been killed in 14 months of war, according to local health officials.\n\nHamas leaders held talks with Egyptian security officials on Sunday to explore ways to reach a deal with Israel that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-11/231114-omer-neutra-cs-e9a8e8.png", "eventUri": "eng-10135563", "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 43, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "2024-11-558023814", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-26", "time": "22:04:20", "dateTime": "2024-11-26T22:04:20Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-26T22:01:55Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8509804010391235, "url": "https://freebeacon.com/campus/enough-is-enough-foxx-introduces-bipartisan-bill-prohibiting-aid-to-universities-that-boycott-israel/", "title": "'Enough is Enough': Foxx Introduces Bipartisan Bill Prohibiting Aid to Universities That Boycott Israel", "body": "'If an institution is going to capitulate to the BDS movement, there will be consequences,' Foxx says\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.), the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, unveiled a bipartisan bill that would prohibit federal aid from flowing to universities that boycott Israel.\n\nFoxx unveiled the measure, the \"Protect Economic Freedom Act,\" alongside Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.) on Tuesday. It would amend the Higher Education Act to bar universities that engage in the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement from receiving federal student aid. Under the legislation, universities must submit annual certifications to the Department of Education, showing they are not engaged in a commercial boycott of Israel.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Appeasing the antisemitic mobs on college campuses threatens the safety of Jewish students and faculty, and it undermines the relationship between the U.S. and one of our strongest allies,\" Foxx said in a statement. \"If an institution is going to capitulate to the BDS movement, there will be consequences -- starting with the Protect Economic Freedom Act.\"\n\nIn the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel, student radicals across the country mobilized to introduce BDS resolutions aimed at compelling their schools to divest from companies with ties to the Jewish state.\n\nWhile the terror-tied Palestinian BDS National Committee says it targets companies implicated in Israel's \"unfolding genocide in Gaza,\" its boycott list includes a who's who of corporate giants. Chevron, for example, is included because it extracts natural gas in Israel. Intel is a target because it maintains research and development centers in the Jewish state.\n\nSome top schools, like Brown University and the University of Michigan, have rejected BDS measures in recent months. Still, more than 30 student governments at universities across the country have passed boycott resolutions, according to the Palestinian BDS National Committee, which counts Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other U.S.-designated terror organizations as members.\n\nThirty-eight U.S. have anti-BDS laws on the books, including Foxx's North Carolina and Gottheimer's New Jersey. For Gottheimer, the new bill is necessary to further \"protect our Jewish community.\"\n\n\"While students and faculty are free to speak their minds and disagree on policy issues, we cannot allow antisemitism to run rampant and risk the safety and security of Jewish students, staff, faculty, and guests on college campuses,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \"The new bipartisan Project Economic Freedom Act will give the Department of Education a critical new tool to combat the antisemitic BDS movement on college campuses.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lexi_boccuzzi@freebeacon.com", "name": "Lexi Boccuzzi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-451904012.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10124866", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 43, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8425888798", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-23", "time": "22:32:11", "dateTime": "2024-11-23T22:32:11Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-23T22:31:13Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/11/23/javier-milei-announces-argentina-israel-alliance-against-terrorism/", "title": "Javier Milei Announces Argentina-Israel Alliance Against Terrorism", "body": "President Javier Milei of Argentina announced a new formal alliance with Israel on Thursday, calling it \"a bilateral alliance for freedom, democracy, and against terrorism and dictatorships.\"\n\nThe announcement came the same day as the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved warrants for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, over objections from the United States and Argentina as well.\n\nMilei, an admirer of Israel and the Jewish faith, slammed his predecessors for their closeness to the Iranian regime, which was responsible for a massive terror attack on the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994.\n\nHe pledged to support the fight against terrorism, and to stand up for the values of the West against their enemies.\n\nEarlier this year, during a visit to Israel, Milei signed a treaty on social rights with the Israeli government.

Then there were those that had the rug pulled out from under them, like the Star Wars series The Acolyte, Netflix's Greek god epic Kaos, and Taika Waititi's fan-favorite Our Flag Means Death.\n\nStill, where some TV doors close, new browser windows open, and next year looks to be packed to the rafters with big-budget swings like a new Game of Thrones prequel and a positively stacked Apple TV+ originals slate, as well as highly anticipated returning faves like The White Lotus, The Bear, and The Traitors.\n\nWe've narrowed down the shows we think will be on everyone's lips in 2025.\n\nBrand new\n\nLockerbie: A Search for Truth (Peacock)\n\nJan. 2\n\nJust days before Christmas in 1988, the UK saw its deadliest terror attack in history when a Pan Am flight was blown up over the small Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people. In Lockerbie: A Search for Truth, Colin Firth takes on the role of Jim Swire, who lost his daughter in the explosion and became the spokesperson for families who lost loved ones on board. He believes the government is covering up what really happened on the flight, but as 36 years of history reveal, the story is never clear.\n\nAmerican Primeval (Netflix)\n\nJan. 9\n\nIf the title of Netflix's gritty new drama implies something dangerous and evil, well, that's the idea. American Primeval chronicles the birth of the American West, with all the perils and violence that came with warring cultures and religions vying for dominance. Taylor Kitsch leads Peter Berg's series as a traumatized man traversing the terrain, with the always excellent Betty Gilpin as a mother looking for a guide across the country. They hope for freedom, but in the frontier, the best they can ask for may be survival.\n\nThe Pitt (Max)\n\nJan. 9\n\nNoah Wyle as an ER doc? In 2025? It's more likely than you think. The Pitt sees Wyle return to the fluorescent-lit hospital halls as the chief attendant at a Pittsburgh hospital. More 24 than ER, each episode of the series follows one hour in Wyle's 15-hour shift and aims to show the relentless conditions for modern-day healthcare workers in America, from crammed waiting rooms to nursing shortages.\n\nPrime Target (Apple TV+)\n\nJan. 22\n\nAfter the sob-fest that was One Day, we're grateful that Leo Woodall's follow-up series looks to be more adrenaline-spiking than tear-jerking. Prime Target follows Woodall's Edward Brooks, a math genius (hence the reference to prime numbers) on the brink of a major breakthrough who senses someone may be trying to thwart his discovery. He and the FBI agent sent to spy on him (Quintessa Swindell) will attempt to unravel the conspiracy at the heart of both of their work.\n\nWatson (CBS)\n\nJan. 26\n\nIf there are three things that the average TV viewer loves, they are medical dramas, police procedurals, and innovative spins on recognizable IP. Enter Watson, the new series about Sherlock Holmes' doctor sidekick, which bills itself as part medical mystery, part detective show. Morris Chestnut takes the mantle of John Watson (following Lucy Liu's run in the character's last primetime procedural outing in Elementary), who, after the death of Sherlock Holmes, sets up his own practice dedicated to strange and unusual medical issues.\n\nParadise (Hulu)\n\nJan. 28\n\nSterling K. Brown is teaming back up with This Is Us creator Dan Fogleman for this series centered around the murder of the President of the United States (played by James Marsden, always a joy to see pop up in things). Brown plays the head of security, who just so happens to have been the last person to see him alive after being let in on something top secret and potentially world-altering. Cue the intrigue, espionage, gripping mysteries, and Brown doing what he does best: expertly playing a character we don't know whether to root for or against.\n\nSNL 50th Anniversary Special (NBC)\n\nFeb. 16\n\nSNL's birthday bash has been a full-season affair so far, with legacy hosts and returning cast members galore. The actual big five-oh celebration for Lorne Michaels' comedy brainchild will be a three-hour live special dedicated to the sketch show's half-century run. Details so far are thin on the ground, with no word yet on who will take on hosting duties and who from the show's illustrious run will be back for some nostalgic commemoration. Based on the show's 40th anniversary special 10 years ago, we can certainly expect a carousel of big names and multiple musical guests.\n\nZero Day (Netflix)\n\nFeb. 20\n\nZero Day, Netflix's upcoming political thriller, marks Robert De Niro's first step into the world of prestige TV, an impressive feat to hold off on considering so many of his A-list peers have made the jump over the last few years. He'll be joined by Jesse Plemons, Dan Stevens, Lizzy Caplan, and Angela Bassett in the series, about a beloved and former United States president (De Niro, naturally) as he leads the investigation into a catastrophic cyberattack.\n\nThe Americas (NBC)\n\nFeb. 23\n\nMove over David Attenborough, Tom Hanks is coming for your bag. Hanks takes on narrating duties for this expansive docuseries that shows the beauty of nature spanning the most remote parts of both North and South America. The series was filmed over five years, taking viewers from the top of the world in the Arctic to the bottom in the Antarctic.\n\nSuits LA (NBC)\n\nFeb. 23\n\nIf there's one thing that L.A. has in abundance, it's lawyers. So it makes sense that the first spin-off of Suits, the wildly popular, Meghan Markle-starring series about NYC attorneys that became a behemoth streaming hit after it ended in 2019, would decamp for the West Coast. The series stars Stephen Amell as a federal prosecutor from New York who moves to Hollywood to represent some of Los Angeles' most powerful clients. Maggie Grace will also star.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again (Disney+)\n\nMarch 4\n\nIt's been a long, long road to get us to Daredevil: Born Again's release. The long-awaited solo return for Charlie Cox's blind superhero outside of the short-lived Marvel-Netflix partnership was first announced in 2022, but by 2023 it was undertaking a massive creative overhaul with The Punisher's Dario Scardapane brought in as showrunner. The show, which has been billed as a continuation of the character's initial three-season Netflix run rather than a reboot, will bring back series originals Cox, Vincent D'Onofrio as villain Kingpin, and Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson as Foggy Nelson and Karen Page to the gritty streets of New York's Hell's Kitchen.\n\nDope Thief (Apple TV+)\n\nMarch 14\n\nDope Thief is another crime novel adaptation set to hit the small screen next year. Top Gun: Maverick screenwriter Peter Craig's 2009 story will star Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura as a duo that runs a grift posing as DEA agents to rob an unknown house in the countryside, only to realize they've stumbled across the biggest narcotics corridor on the East Coast. Ridley Scott will executive produce.\n\nThe Residence (Netflix)\n\nMarch 20\n\nSo far, Netflix's more than $100-million deal with Shonda Rhimes has given us the bodice-ripping behemoth Bridgerton, its spin-off Queen Charlotte, and the Anna Delvey miniseries Inventing Anna. The newest jewel in the crown is The Residence, a murder mystery set within the walls of the White House. Described as an \"upstairs, downstairs, and backstairs\" story, the series stars Uzo Aduba as the eccentric detective alongside Giancarlo Esposito and Randall Park.\n\nThe Studio (Apple TV+)\n\nMarch 26\n\nThe sign of truly making it in Hollywood isn't an award or a mansion in the hills, it's wracking up enough cach\u00e9 to get Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Charlize Theron, Zac Efron, and Kathryn Hahn to berate you on screen. The Studio stars Seth Rogen as a movie studio head on the brink of existential crisis as he tries to toe the line between making art and \"movies with a capital M.\" The trailer alone is like a rolodex of big-name cameos playing heightened versions of themselves, which, when executed well, can be delightful.\n\nYour Friends & Neighbors (Apple TV+)\n\nApril 11\n\nJon Hamm as a somewhat sociopathic businessman conning his way through New York? We think we've seen this one before. In Your Friends & Neighbors, Hamm will lead his first TV series since Mad Men and suit back up as a hedge fund manager who, after losing his job and marriage, starts stealing from the wealthy residents of his suburb. Naturally, the con gets out of hand, and when he steals the wrong thing from the wrong house, his new life of petty crime starts to unravel. The series will also star Olivia Munn and Amanda Peet.\n\nGovernment Cheese (Apple TV+)\n\nApril 16\n\nAnother series in Apple TV+'s loaded slate is Government Cheese, starring and executive-produced by David Oyelowo. The surrealist comedy is set in 1969 and revolves around a quirky family in L.A. Oyelowo plays its patriarch who, after being released from prison, tries to curry favor with his wife and kids who resent his absence and have seemingly built a strange life around lofty pursuits and odd hobbies in the time he's been away. The show is created by Paul Hunter, dubbed one of the most influential hip-hop music video directors of all time. Unsurprisingly, early images of the series look gorgeous.\n\nAlien: Earth (FX)\n\nSummer TBA\n\nThe Alien franchise has had a long and storied existence in cinema (the latest installment, Alien: Romulus, came out this year), but Alien: Earth will be its first live-action iteration on TV. They've brought in the big guns for the xenomorph's small-screen debut, roping in Fargo series creator Noah Hawley to helm the (space) ship. The series is a prequel to the original 1979 Ridley Scott film starring Sigourney Weaver and takes place on Earth after a mysterious vessel containing a dangerous entity (three guesses for what it might be!) threatens life as we know it.\n\nStick (Apple TV+)\n\nTBA\n\nOwen Wilson is pitching on the green in Stick, a comedy about golf. He stars as Pryce Cahill, an ex-pro golfer who, after having his career prematurely cut short, becomes the coach for a troubled but talented 17-year-old. If you've seen Eddie the Eagle (2016) or The Karate Kid (1984), you might get a sense of what we're in for. There's still a lot of mystery around this series, but we do know that Timothy Olyphant and Judy Greer will also star.\n\nSmoke (Apple TV+)\n\nTBA\n\nTaron Egerton will team back up with Black Bird creator Dennis Lehane for Smoke, a fictionalized take on the true-crime podcast of the same name about the hunt for an arsonist who seemed to confess their crimes in a novel manuscript. Egerton will star as an enigmatic arson investigator on the hunt for two serial arsonists terrorizing the area. The series will also star Jurnee Smollet, John Leguizamo, and Rafe Spall.\n\nChief of War (Apple TV+)\n\nTBA\n\nJason Momoa wears multiple hats in Chief of War, a series he wrote, executive produced and stars in. It tells the story of the bloody and brutal colonization of Hawaii from the indigenous point of view, and Momoa stars as the warrior Ka'iana, known as the \"most famous Hawaiian in the world.\"\n\nA Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (HBO)\n\nTBA\n\nThe Game of Thrones universe continues to expand its reach. Along with House of the Dragon, 2025 will see another prequel come our way. The series is set 100 years before House of the Dragon's Targaryen turf war and is based on the Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas in George R. R. Martin's original A Song of Ice and Fire series. It revolves around a naive knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his squire known as Egg. Martin will write the series and has said it will have a different tone to its successors but it's still Westeros so \"No one is truly safe.\"\n\nChad Powers (Hulu)\n\nTBA\n\n\"Glen Powell Summer\" is extending its run into 2025 with Chad Powers, a comedy series Powell co-created with Michael Waldron based on Eli Manning's character of the same name. Taking inspo from Manning's ESPN docuseries in which he went undercover during college football tryouts, Powell will play a disgraced college quarterback who tries to get a second shot at his big break by disguising himself on a new college team under a different identity (bad wig and prosthetics included!).\n\nThe Four Seasons (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nFor those pleading for the return of good old-fashioned classic rom-coms, you may be in luck with The Four Seasons, Tina Fey's remake of the 1981 Alan Alda and Carol Burnett comedy, which was a love story about friendship as much as it was a romance. The story follows three couples who vacation with each other each season, but their harmony is thrown off balance when one of them gets divorced and brings a new partner into the fold. Fey will lead the show and reunite with her Date Night co-star Steve Carrell. Elsewhere in the cast, we have Will Forte, Colman Domingo, Kerri Kenney-Silver, and Erika Henningsen.\n\nIT: Welcome to Derry (HBO)\n\nTBA\n\nThe snapshots of the child-murdering sewer clown Pennywise's history that we got in It (2017) and It Chapter Two (2019) inform the story of Welcome to Derry, the prequel series about Maine's most haunted town. Taking place 27 years before Stephen King's original novel (because Pennywise only shows up in 27-year intervals), the show will explore the town's first sightings and experiences with the dancing clown. Set in the 1960s, expect all the hallmarks of King's penchant for vintage vignettes, including the looming fear of the Cold War as well as whatever monsters live beneath the sewer grates.\n\nLong Bright River (Peacock)\n\nTBA\n\nLiz Moore's novel Long Bright River topped multiple year-end critics lists and was named one of Barack Obama's favorite books of the year when it was released in 2020, so naturally, it is heading to the small screen with an adaptation. Amanda Seyfried will star in the series which follows a beat cop working as the opioid crisis grips the streets of Philadelphia. Her sister, who she's more or less estranged from, battles on the fringes of addiction and the latest danger that sweeps the city, a killer who targets sex workers.\n\nRunning Point (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nAfter Mindy Kaling wrapped up her Netflix high school rom-com Never Have I Ever last year, questions turned to where she'd go next. The answer is not very far. She is back with the streamer for her next creation, Running Point, a Kate Hudson-starring series about a woman who inherits the top seat of her family business -- one of the biggest basketball franchises in the country. Sitcom lovers will rejoice at the show's supporting cast, which includes Drew Tarver, of the sublimely hilarious The Other Two, Brenda Song, whose renaissance the internet is cheering on enthusiastically, and Max Greenfield, who's not playing Schmidt from New Girl but who will always be Schmidt in our hearts.\n\nToo Much (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nIf you, like seemingly the rest of the world in 2024, decided to rewatch Girls and now yearn for more of Lena Dunham's specific lens on the world of friendship and romance, you're in luck! She's back with Too Much, a series she's written with her husband Luis Felber, about a New Yorker who moves to London after a painful breakup and meets a handsome and kind local. Considering Dunham herself moved from the Big Apple to the other side of the pond and married a hot Brit, we sense there could be some autobiographical license. If the premise wasn't enough, Dunham has roped in Meg Stalter, consistently one of the funniest people on screen (watch Hacks!) and The White Lotus Season 2's hunky nerd Will Sharpe. We're so back, baby!\n\nVictoria Beckham docuseries (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nAlthough Netflix's mononymous David Beckham 2023 docuseries focused on the footballer's ascent to \"Golden Balls\" status, it was his wife Victoria, the fashion designer and former Spice Girl, who came out as the real star. The series reminded viewers that behind the pout, Victoria has always had a razor-sharp wit and isn't precious when it comes to joking about herself (as seen in her previous satirical reality show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America). Unsurprisingly, the streamer has jumped on that goodwill and greenlit another series, this time focused on Victoria and her shift from extravagant pop star to quiet luxury fashion mogul.\n\nReturning\n\nThe Traitors Season 3 (Peacock)\n\nJan. 9\n\nThe most gripping reality TV series out there, The Traitors is thankfully returning very early on in 2025. Happy New Year to us! The show where celebrities are pitted against each other in a high-stakes party game of Mafia, in which some are designated secret \"traitors\" who are vying to get others eliminated to steal the top prize, is heading back to the Scottish Highlands with Alan Cumming as host (we would riot if not!) and the likes of Bob the Drag Queen, Chrishell Stause, Dorinda Medley, and Tom Sandoval competing in the mix.\n\nSeverance Season 2 (Apple TV+)\n\nJan. 17\n\nThe wait between Seasons 1 and 2 of Ben Stiller's high-concept workplace drama felt longer than that stretch between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. at the office on any given Wednesday, but finally, it's upon us. Adam Scott is back as Mark, an employee of Lumon, where employees can separate their work memories from their real-life memories. Season 1 gave us plenty of mysteries about what Lumon is actually up to; let's hope Season 2 gives us some answers before it clocks out for the end of its shift.\n\nThe Night Agent Season 2 (Netflix)\n\nJan. 23\n\nAfter its first season launched as one of the most watched shows in Netflix's history, it was only a matter of time (a month, to be exact) before The Night Agent was greenlit for a second (and third) series. Gabriel Basso's FBI agent Peter Sutherland is back for more explosive twists and turns as he gets further immersed in Night Action, a secret organization full of danger.\n\nMo Season 2 (Netflix)\n\nJan. 30\n\nMo Amer's semi-autobiographical comedy series about his life as a Palestinian refugee in Houston is back for a second season. The show, which is co-created by Ramy Youssef, will pick up with Mo's continued attempts at seeking asylum in the U.S., but in Season 2 he's stranded across the border in Mexico without a passport.\n\nYellowjackets Season 3 (Showtime)\n\nFeb 14\n\nWhat better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than with a bit of survival-based cannibalism? Season 2 of Yellowjackets, the dual-timeline series about a group of teens who got stranded in the wilderness, created even more tension and questions than its first outing. In Season 3, it looks like the team is getting hunted by someone who knows their secret -- but everyone who knows the story is \"us or dead.\"\n\nThe White Lotus Season 3 (HBO)\n\nFeb. 16\n\nThe third installment of Mike White's resort-based murder mystery is one of the most anticipated shows of 2025, especially after the culture-shifting ending of its second season in late 2022. Following from Hawaii and then Italy, this series takes place at the White Lotus branch in Thailand. Naturally, White has cobbled together a killer (literally, perhaps) cast including Parker Posey, Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, and Lisa from the K-pop girl group Blackpink.\n\nAndor Season 2 (Disney+)\n\nApril 22\n\nStar Wars spin-off shows haven't had the most success lately, but Andor is a shining jewel among the expansive galaxy's offerings. The show chronicles the events leading up to 2016's Rogue One, with intelligence officer Cassian Andor anchoring the series. While Season 1 took place over a single year, Season 2 will span four years.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale Season 6 (Hulu)\n\nSpring TBA\n\nIt will have been almost three years since the last season of The Handmaid's Tale by the time Season 6, the show's last, lands in our laps next year, but the creators have promised that the wait will have been worth it. Season 5 left us with an unlikely team-up and an increasingly authoritarian threat in Canada.\n\nThe Bear Season 4 (FX)\n\nTBA\n\nThe Bear's popularity has bubbled over like a pot of boiling water since its debut. Its second season swept every award going and while its third season was met with a more mixed bag of reviews, it's still one of the most talked about shows on TV right now -- not least because it's banging out seasons in a way we haven't seen in decades. Four seasons in four years? We forgot we could live like this!\n\nBlack Mirror Season 7 (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nCharlie Brooker's satirical anthology about technology's chokehold on us will be back for a seventh season, so be prepared to start looking at your cell phone or air fryer with some suspicion again. The series will include Emma Corrin, Paul Giamatti, Rashida Jones, Cristin Milioti, and Chris O'Dowd.\n\nThe Buccaneers Season 2 (Apple TV+)\n\nTBA\n\nApple TV+'s answer to Bridgerton is The Buccaneers, the story of five ambitious high-society American women navigating the culture clash of 1870s London. Greg Wise and Leighton Meester will be joining the show's second season.\n\nEuphoria Season 3 (HBO)\n\nTBA\n\nNever has a TBA been more TBA than when it comes to Euphoria, Sam Levinson's dive into the drug-addled, sex-fueled lives of teenagers. While its cast, including Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, and Sydney Sweeney, have entered bonafide Hollywood A-list status since its hiatus began in 2022, Levinson has confirmed that the show will be back for a third season that's due to start filming in January. It's said there will be a time jump from last season, meaning the characters will have aged out of being teenagers.\n\nThe Gilded Age Season 3 (HBO)\n\nTBA\n\nJulian Fellowes' The Gilded Age, set in late-1800s New York, proves that great drama can be found anywhere, even in high-society quibbles over who has the superior opera house. Season 3 will see an evolving New York, where the old guard has been usurped and new socialites run the town.\n\nThe Last of Us Season 2\n\nTBA\n\nThe Last of Us became one of the most popular and gripping shows with its 2023 debut, putting to bed the idea that video games can't be successfully adapted to the screen and solidifying Pedro Pascal's \"Internet Daddy\" status. Season 2 will be based on the game's second installment, Part II, meaning we're time-jumping a few years into the future with Bella Ramsey's Ellie being 19 rather than 14.\n\nPoker Face Season 2 (Peacock)\n\nTBA\n\nRian Johnson has truly cornered the market in whodunits or, as he calls Poker Face, a howcatchem. Natasha Lyonne will return as Charlie Cale, a case-of-the-week Las Vegas detective, pointing fingers at all manner of big-name guest stars. Kumail Nanjiani, Katie Holmes, John Mulaney, Ego Nwodim, and Sam Richardson will all pop by this season.\n\nStranger Things Season 5 (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nIt's been so long since Stranger Things' last season that we're almost ready to bring \"Running Up That Hill\" for its second cultural renaissance just to feel something. Still, the wait will hopefully be worth it as we get ready to say goodbye to Hawkins, the Upside Down, and all the characters who are definitely still supposed to be 15-year-olds despite this show nearing its 10th anniversary. After Hawkins gave way to Vecna's destruction last season, the gang will have to pool together one last time to save their town from its biggest villain yet.\n\nWednesday Season 2 (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nWednesday Season 1 launched to unprecedented levels of popularity in 2023, usurping Stranger Things' chokehold when it came to streaming numbers. Its second installment has a lot to live up to, but if Jenna Ortega's sardonic take on the classic pigtail-braided character has taught us anything, it's that we should never underestimate The Addams Family (and that black really does look good with everything).\n\nYou Season 5 (Netflix)\n\nTBA\n\nWill Joe Goldberg finally get what's coming to him? That's the question we'll all be asking as we head into You's final season. After murdering his way through New York, California, and London with varying degrees of success, Penn Badgley's stalking serial killer is back on home turf, although this time he's got a multi-millionaire wife to hide behind.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ak3eh7cqgBUp9S8JDcZLKg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_time_773/1638770930861b312bd406e463bb6c69", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 41, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8430443612", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-26", "time": "22:10:09", "dateTime": "2024-11-26T22:10:09Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-26T22:09:47Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2024/11/viral-claim-falsely-suggests-trump-ended-violence-in-gaza/", "title": "Viral Claim Falsely Suggests Trump Ended Violence in Gaza - FactCheck.org", "body": "Este art\u00edculo estar\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol en El Tiempo Latino.\n\nAttacks by Israeli forces and Hamas continue to kill or displace people in the Gaza Strip. But social media posts misleadingly claim Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election led Hamas to call for an end to the war in Gaza. Hamas has called for a ceasefire several times before the election. And the violence has continued since Election Day.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes killed at least 46 people in the Gaza Strip on Nov. 12. An Israeli attack on a refugee camp school left at least 10 people dead on Nov. 16. And on Nov. 23 the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for a northern Gaza suburb due to rocket fire from Hamas.\n\nAll of this happened after it became clear on Nov. 6 that former President Donald Trump had won a second term in the White House.\n\nBut a claim that arose shortly after the election has continued to spread online, suggesting that Trump's win resulted in an end to the violence in Gaza.\n\nStarting the day after the election, some widely followed accounts posted a screenshot of a headline that said, \"Hamas Calls for 'Immediate' End to War After Trump Election Win.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr., for example, posted the screenshot on Truth Social and Instagram with the message, \"It took about 12 hours after my father's election win for Hamas to call for peace! @realDonaldTrump isn't even president yet and he's already getting it done. Spectacular.\" Many replies to his post indicated that readers understood it to mean that Trump had ended the war.\n\n\"Trump brings world peace and saves millions of lives and liberals will somehow call him racist,\" one commenter said.\n\nOthers spread similarly suggestive claims without the screenshot, including YouTube influencer and professional boxer Jake Paul, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for the White House. On Nov. 7, he posted on X a list titled, \"Trump 48 hours not even in office,\" and included as the third item, \"Hamas calls for 'immediate end to war.'\"\n\nThat claim has continued to spread. Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler posted about it on Nov. 8 and Kayleigh McEnany, who served as press secretary during Trump's first term, repeated the claim on the Nov. 11 episode of her Fox News show, \"Outnumbered.\"\n\nAnd it continues to spread across social media. Another list of Trump's supposed pre-inauguration accomplishments posted to Facebook on Nov. 16 says Hamas has called for an immediate end to the war and claims, \"It has been ONLY 11 days since Donald J. Trump elected, there's already PEACE around the WORLD.\"\n\nBut, of course, Trump's election has not yet ushered in peace in Gaza, and any posts suggesting that it has are wrong.\n\n\"It's impossible for that to be true because the battle is still going on on multiple fronts,\" Ibrahim Abusharif, a professor of journalism and strategic communication at Northwestern University in Qatar, told us in an interview. The fact that the claim is proliferating so widely on social media \"just reminds us again that this is an unreliable space for information, for facts, and for truth telling,\" he said.\n\nThe headline at the root of this claim is real. It appeared on Newsweek's website on Nov. 6. But presenting it on its own, detached from the accompanying story, is misleading since it could be used to suggest that Trump is responsible for ending the violence in Gaza.\n\nThe full story explains that a senior Hamas official told Newsweek: \"The election of Trump as the 47th president of the USA is a private matter for the Americans, but Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self-sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" (As president, Trump proposed a \"realistic two-state solution\" in 2020 with Jerusalem as Israel's \"undivided capital.\")\n\nHamas' calls for an end to the violence aren't new. The group has sought a ceasefire at several points since Israeli forces struck Gaza following the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and abducted 254. The Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by the Hamas-controlled government, has reported more than 44,000 people killed in Gaza since the war began.\n\nForecasting what effect the incoming Trump administration may have on the war between Israel and Hamas is difficult, experts agree.\n\n\"Donald Trump's election introduces new uncertainty into Middle East affairs,\" Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, wrote on Nov. 14.\n\nSachs suggested that the Arab Gulf states and Israel \"may now be eager to give Trump early 'wins,' to capitalize on the relationship for their own interests and in the hope that Trump shows more flexibility as he enters office.\"\n\n\"Trump historically, and those around him, have been very sympathetic to Israel,\" Warren Strobel, the Wall Street Journal's intelligence and security reporter, answered when asked at a panel discussion what the Trump administration would likely mean for the conflict there. \"I think you will see, by and large, support for Israel in the region.\"\n\nStrobel predicted the Trump administration would likely increase its previous maximum pressure campaign aimed at reigning in Iran's nuclear program, largely by imposing economic sanctions, which could affect funding for Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, a Shiite militant group based in Lebanon and funded largely by Iran, clashed with Israel immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, leading to a more than yearlong fight on the Israel-Lebanon border. On Nov. 26, 2024, Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. The deal does not end the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what impact Trump's second presidency will have on the war in Gaza.\n\n\"He's fickle,\" Abusharif said of Trump's likely approach. \"He has a history of making muscular promises and not following up.\"\n\nSo we don't know what will happen in Gaza during Trump's next term. But we do know that the fighting continues, regardless of the results of the U.S. election.\n\nAbusharif, Ibrahim.

The detentions can be renewed indefinitely while allowing military prosecutors to keep suspects from being able to see the evidence against them.\n\n\"In a reality where the Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria is subject to serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements,\" Katz said in a statement, referring to the West Bank by its biblical name.\n\nKatz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided \"to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,\" Katz's office said.\n\nThe Shin Bet has reportedly warned against the move, with Bar saying in June that banning the measure against Israelis \"will result in an immediate, severe and serious harm to the security of the state\" in cases where there is clear information that a suspect may carry out a terror attack.\n\nAdministrative detention policies allow the Defense Ministry to hold suspects without charge, while administrative restraining orders bar them from visiting certain areas or communicating with certain people. The tool is typically used when authorities have intelligence tying a suspect to a crime but do not have enough evidence for charges to stand up in a court of law.\n\nCurrently, more than 3,400 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians, are being held in administrative detention, according to figures from the Israel Prison Service.\n\nA total of 16 administrative detention orders were issued for Jewish Israelis under former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and seven of them are still being held.\n\nKatz said that \"if there is suspicion of criminal acts, the perpetrators can be prosecuted, and if not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken other than administrative detention orders.\"\n\n\"I condemn any phenomenon of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one's own hands, and I also appeal to the settlement leadership to take a similar public position and express an unequivocal position on the issue,\" the minister added.\n\nSettler violence spiked after the October 7, 2023, Hamas onslaught in the south. Israeli authorities rarely arrest Jewish perpetrators in such attacks. Some rights groups lament that convictions are even more unusual and that the vast majority of charges in these types of attacks are dropped.\n\nAs recently as this past weekend, dozens of masked settlers set fire to several buildings and a car in the West Bank village of Beit Furik near Nablus, according to the IDF. There has been no news of arrests.\n\nThe defense minister's decision was welcomed by right-wing politicians, with far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, a former settler activist who was previously convicted of terror-related offenses, calling the move \"important and huge news... This is a correction of many years of mistreatment, and justice for those who love the land.\"\n\nFinance Minster Bezalel Smotrich, a settlement advocate, said Katz \"eliminated long-standing discrimination against settlers in Judea and Samaria and put an end to the injustice in which the settlers were second-class citizens and draconian and undemocratic measures were applied against them that trampled on their rights, measures that are not applied against any other population in the State of Israel except terrorists and dangerous enemies.\"\n\nSmotrich clarified that if the \"unacceptable phenomenon\" of settler violence occurs, it \"should be handled by the police and the legal system in accordance with the procedures and rules of evidence of criminal law, just as they would be with any other citizen or population.\"\n\nJustice Minister Yariv Levin congratulated Katz on his decision, calling the move an \"end to discrimination.\"\n\nLevin added that the \"pioneer settlers in Judea and Samaria are overwhelmingly law-abiding. Cases of illegal violence should be handled as is customary with respect to any Israeli citizen and in accordance with the law, as is customary everywhere in the country.\"\n\nMK Simcha Rothman, the chairman of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, welcomed the announcement as a \"moral, just and correct decision.\"\n\nA bill sponsored by Rothman -- which would forbid the use of administrative detention or administrative restraining orders against Israeli citizens, unless they are members of a certain list of terror groups -- is currently making its way through the Knesset.\n\nNot all Israeli politicians supported the move, with MK Gadi Eisenkot, a former IDF chief of staff and current centrist opposition lawmaker, calling it \"a grave and dangerous mistake.\"\n\n\"This is another step toward a severe escalation in Judea and Samaria, for which we will all pay the price,\" Eisenkot warned.\n\n\"The goal of such orders is not law-abiding Jewish citizens but extremist terror elements who tarnish and endanger us as a society,\" he said. \"This step joins other deliberate measures that harm the IDF's ability to fulfill its role as the sovereign authority responsible for the safety and security of residents.\"\n\nHadash-Ta'al MK Ahmad Tibi lambasted the move, saying that \"this is effectively the defense minister's certification of approval for Jewish terror -- a government of terror supporters. Administrative detention applies only to Palestinians. This is yet more proof of the regime of Jewish supremacy. Later, they'll cry about 'antisemitism' in The Hague. In short, administrative detention does not apply to those whose veins flow with blue-and-white blood, members of the 'supreme Jewish race.'\"\n\nThe left-wing Yesh Din human rights nonprofit said that \"administrative detention is a draconian and anti-democratic measure that should be stopped against Palestinians and Israelis alike.\"\n\n\"Instead, law enforcement agencies should conduct effective investigations and bring to justice when there is sufficient evidence to do so. Let us recall that thousands of Palestinians are being held in administrative detention under administrative detention orders that Minister Katz has not revoked,\" the group added.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "in_jerusalem@timesofisrael.com", "name": "In Jerusalem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/11/F241107YS231.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-10109154", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 37, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8454968780", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-12", "time": "19:16:59", "dateTime": "2024-12-12T19:16:59Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-12T19:16:41Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/australian-jewish-community-alarmed-amid-rising-antisemitism-fear-anxiety", "title": "Australia's Jewish community alarmed by rising antisemitism: 'Fear and anxiety'", "body": "By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.\n\nA devastating arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue is now being investigated as a possible terror attack, drawing worldwide attention to a stark increase in antisemitism in Australia.\n\nMasked vandals set the Adass Israel Synagogue aflame on Dec. 6, in one of several incidents that have left the Jewish community seeking support from government leaders.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sky News Australia reported a car was destroyed after being set on fire in a Jewish community in Sydney. At least two, but possibly as many as seven, buildings in the area were vandalized, with one graffiti tag reading \"kill Israiel\" (sic). This rash of hate followed in the wake of a similar incident late last month, when vehicles and a restaurant in the same area were covered with graffiti.\n\nFollowing the attacks in Sydney, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told Sky News Australia, \"Sydney, per capita, has the second-highest number of Holocaust survivors in the world,\" explaining that they came \"to Australia specifically to be free from this kind of hate.\"\n\nJEWISH CHILDREN, TEENS VIOLENTLY ATTACKED IN LONDON: 'STREETS ARE NO LONGER SAFE'\n\nWorshiper Yumi Friedman told Avi Yemini of Rebel News that he was inside the synagogue when he heard banging on the door and saw glass flying. Friedman later said he smelled fire and burned his hand while attempting to open the synagogue door.\n\nFriedman said that responding police told Jewish worshipers to get on the ground and show their hands. \"They came and arrested us,\" he said. \"It took them a while to realize that we're Jewish and we didn't do this.\"\n\nZionism is not a feature of the Haredi Judaism that worshipers at the Adass Israel Synagogue practice. Yemini asked members of the community why they believed the non-Zionist synagogue was targeted. \"Jews are Jews,\" a man wearing a kippah replied. \"They're anti-Jews,\" another visibly Jewish man told Yemini. \"Not anti-anything else.\"\n\nYemini filmed a protester outside the firebombed synagogue wearing a keffiyeh and a baseball cap featuring the Palestinian flag who held a sign stating \"Nothing is more antisemitic than Zionism.\"\n\nNumerous community members interviewed by Yemini said they felt unsupported by the local government. \"People have been attacked here,\" one man reminded Victoria Police Detective Inspector Chris Murray, who was present to address the community. \"Why don't you put someone in here?\"\n\n\"We're doing our best,\" Murray responded.\n\nMurray told crowds that police would \"do everything\" to \"bring these individuals before the courts.\" Though they believed the attack was targeted, Murray said that \"what we don't know is why.\"\n\nShane Patton, Victoria police chief commissioner, told reporters at a press conference that the firebombing is being investigated as \"a likely terror attack.\"\n\nCALLS FOR US TO DO MORE AS ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS SKYROCKET IN EUROPE: 'ENORMOUSLY PAINFUL'\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has been lambasted for his response to the Melbourne attack, which a Sky News Australia host said was \"four days too late.\" Yemini documented Albanese's visit to the Adass Israel Synagogue. When the kippah-wearing prime minister failed to answer questions from assembled reporters, Yemini followed him to the car, telling Albanese that \"yesterday was the first time you didn't conflate antisemitism and Islamophobia.\"\n\nThough it has faced more intolerance, the Jewish population of Australia is around one-eighth the size of the Muslim population, and has been stagnant or declining while the percentage of Muslims has grown. In 2016, Jewish Australians made up 0.5% of the population, according to Monash University. Muslims made up 2.6% of the population in 2016, according to the University of South Australia. Today, Muslims account for 3.2% of the Australian population while 0.4% of the population is Jewish.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent attacks, Albanese stated that the Australian Federal Police will be conducting an operation that would \"focus on threats, violence, and hatred\" targeting the Jewish community. Reuters reported that Albanese has allocated $25 million (approximately U.S. $15 million) since 2022 to increase security for Jewish organizations. He has also worked to minimize hate speech and banned the Nazi salute.\n\nMany Jewish Australians believe these efforts are not enough. Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) sent an open letter to Albanese, which it shared with Fox News Digital. The ECAJ explained that \"the very character of this country as a free, democratic and multicultural society is in peril,\" citing the \"fear and anxiety\" experienced by Jewish Australians who question whether it is safe to display signs of their Judaism or publicly celebrate their faith and heritage.\n\nThough the ECAJ expressed gratitude to Albanese for \"swiftly condemning\" the arson in Melbourne, they requested that he act in response to \"what is now a national antisemitism crisis.\" Among their requests are an increase in security funding, support for antisemitism education in schools, enforcement of laws against harassment and intimidation, and support for higher government efforts to curtail antisemitism in universities.\n\nCOLUMBIA GROUP'S ANTISEMITIC NEWSPAPER DRAWS OUTRAGE FROM NY LAWMAKER, AS UNIVERSITY INVESTIGATES\n\nAlbanese's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment about criticisms of the prime minister's reaction to the Melbourne firebombing, his response to the ECAJ's letter, and whether the country's shift regarding a Palestinian state might have an impact on the state of antisemitic hate in Australia.\n\nAs it has worldwide, antisemitism has risen dramatically in Australia since Oct. 7, according to an ECAJ report from November 2024. Reporting entities counted 2,062 antisemitic incidents in Australia between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, compared with 495 incidents tallied during the prior 12 months. This represents a 316% increase in expressions of anti-Jewish hate, which began as early as Oct. 8, when the ECAJ reported that Sheikh Ibrahim Daoud told an audience in western Sydney that he was \"elated,\" explaining, \"it's a day of pride, it's a day of victory.\"\n\nThe ECAJ sent Fox News Digital a trove of photographs showing acts of hate directed against Jewish Australians. These included an incident from November 2023, when unknown individuals sprayed \"Kill Jews\" and \"Jew lives here\" on a residential unit in southeast Melbourne, and wrote \"Jew-free zone\" in a Brunswick window, as reported by the Jewish Independent.\n\nThe government responded to some major acts of antisemitism. In February, anti-Israel activists released a document featuring the \"names and other personal details\" of 600 Jewish musicians, writers, academics and artists in a WhatsApp group whose communications were also leaked.\n\nSeven months later, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced a proposed sentence of up to six years in prison for those who release individuals' private details in order to cause harm. The punishment would increase to seven years if a victim was targeted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, among other factors.\n\nIn recognition of the rising intolerance in Australia, on Dec. 9, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory warning Jews to \"exercise extreme caution\" if visiting the country. As Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's director of global social action, explained, authorities there have failed \"to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_bailey@foxnews.com", "name": "Beth Bailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/12/1024/512/gettyimages-2188481636.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": "eng-10158467", "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 37, "relevance": 13}, {"uri": "8429353199", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-26", "time": "09:02:11", "dateTime": "2024-11-26T09:02:11Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-26T09:01:41Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/26-11-the-day-india-changed-forever-13838964.html", "title": "26/11: The day India changed forever", "body": "A policeman pushes a barricade to be erected in front of the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. The iconic hotel was one of the many spots that the 10 terrorists targeted on the night of November 26, 2008, which is now remembered as the 26/11 attacks. File image/Reuters\n\nThere are points in a nation's history that become watershed moments from where the trajectory of a nation takes an irreversible turn. In the history of independent India too, there have quite a few such path-breaking events. If the first war between India and Pakistan triggered by an infiltration by tribal militias 'Kabalias' in October 1947 hastened the amalgamation of Kashmir into the Indian Union, the 1971 war led to the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh, and the 1999 Kargil War led to a complete review of border security and intelligence infrastructure along the northern Kashmir.\n\nHowever, if there was one event that shook India and has transformed the Indian security mindset, it has to be the Mumbai terror attack of November 26, 2008. It was not as if this was the first terror attack outside Jammu & Kashmir because the Parliament attack of December 2001 or the Pune German Bakery Blast of February 2010 were significant too. But the manner in which India fought back and the fact that the 26/11 attacks specifically targeted places frequented by foreigners, especially Jews, made it even more significant in terms of a security landmark.\n\nWhat Happened That Day?\n\nThe night of November 26, 2008, 10 terrorists from the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group of Pakistan entered Mumbai city across the sea route in inflatable speedboats after embarking from Karachi in a trawler on November 21. Having entered Mumbai fairly undetected and uncontested, they split into small teams to carry out coordinated attacks in carefully chosen places to cause maximum impact. Over the course of the next four days, they killed 166 people and injured 300. The targets -- the Taj and Oberoi Hotels, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Railway Terminus, the Jewish Centre at Nariman House, and the Leopold Cafe -- were carefully chosen, surveyed in detail, and targeted specifically, since these places were often frequented by foreigners, especially Europeans and Jews.\n\nAmong the 166 killed were 141 Indians and 25 foreign nationals, including 6 Americans and 4 Israelis. According to transcripts of phone calls between the terrorists and their handlers during the attack, terrorists were specifically instructed to kill foreigners, especially Jews. Nine terrorists were eliminated while Ajmal Kasab was captured alive, who later confessed to the conspiracy being hatched in Pakistan and executed by LeT.\n\nWhat Changed Thereafter\n\n26/11 was not the biggest terror attack in India and not the last too. The 1993 Mumbai serial attacks had killed 257 people, while the 2006 Mumbai train attack had killed 209 people. 14 months later, the Pune German Bakery Blast in February 2010 too resulted in 18 deaths, including 5 foreign nationals. However, what perhaps changed after 26/11 was the way it shook the national security consciousness. Having witnessed the visuals live on television over four days, it became embedded in public memory forever too.\n\nThere were two other major structural changes that took place, among many others. Firstly, a specific focus was now put on coastal security, with the Indian Navy being entrusted with the overall responsibility of maritime security, including coastal security and offshore security, while the Coast Guard was to guard the territorial waters. The National Command Control Communications and Intelligence (NC3I) Network was set up as part of the maritime security measures.\n\nSurveillance across the long coastline was a challenge. Coupled with satellite coverage, many other measures were instituted, including the fact that all boats with a length greater than 20 meters were required to have an Automatic Identification System (AIS). Systems for better coordination between local police and other security and intelligence agencies too were put in place with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) being set up in December 2008. The National Security Guard (NSG), which operated from Delhi earlier, now had new bases across the country for faster response.\n\nHowever, the biggest change for India that happened as a result of the attack was that for the first time since the 1990s, when India's fought against terror took shape, there was a near unanimous global acceptance that India was fighting its 'war against terror'. Earlier, despite volumes of evidence of Pakistan-based terror attacks in India, most countries and global platforms were rather dismissive about Indian claims, leaving India to fight its battle alone.\n\nThe 26/11 also led to greater intelligence sharing mechanisms between the countries, especially the US, EU, Israel, and Russia, as well as the West Asian region. The acceptance of the Indian line on terror had another significant outcome, something that the Modi government fully capitalised on after 2014, which led to vastly enhanced relations with countries in West Asia and built a number of strategic partnerships.\n\nAgainst a compulsive show of Muslim solidarity with Pakistan earlier, thereby limiting the options to enhance ties with India, there was now a unanimous acceptance of India's position on terror, and on more than one occasion thereafter, the countries in the region have strongly supported India. Whether it was Uri, Pathankote, or Pulwama, countries in the region, especially Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar, not only condemned the attacks strongly but extended support to India in any action (including military) that it took to fight and eradicate terror.\n\nThe Pakistan Factor\n\nA significant result of 26/11 has been India's stance towards Pakistan and its 'no talks till no terror' policy and nullifying the 'Pakistan Factor' in all forums in all possible ways. It has not only led to the isolation of Pakistan in the region but has starved it economically too. The proofs of financial support by Pakistan to terror submitted by India and other global agencies have led to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body that investigates and grades nations on issues of combat money laundering and terrorist financing, sanctioning Pakistan multiple times in the past decade and placing severe restrictions on international aid into the country.\n\nIn addition, Pakistan, which was the poster boy of US policy and the fight against terror in Afghanistan in 2008-09, now finds itself completely out of favour. To add to its woes, with the US-led international forces having left Afghanistan in August 2021, Pakistan is not only left high and dry from a financial point of view but has to also contend with terror attacks on its own soil frequently. Plus, due to India's success in de-hyphenating its ties from the Pakistan factor with the countries in West Asia, the blanket support and aid that Pakistan got from the region earlier is no longer forthcoming.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change has been in the policy mindset of the Indian security establishment. Whether it was Uri in 2016, Pathankot in 2016, or Pulwama in 2019, India, through prompt and effective surgical strikes, has made it clear that Pakistan cannot get away with terror attacks any longer. Also, the nuclear bogey of Pakistan too has been called out, with the air strike deep into Pakistan in Balakot being a clear example of it.\n\nConclusion\n\n26/11, often called the 9/11 of India, was a dark chapter in India's security history, an event that shook the collective security consciousness of India and changed the security paradigm in the region forever. It also made India realise that terror cannot be 'taken in the stride' any longer and that any future attack has to be replied with strong punitive measures in a 'whole of nation approach'.\n\nThe changed approach in Kashmir, with a focus on two-pronged strategy: focus on economic development and infrastructure development on the one hand and very close coordination between the security agencies on the other, has resulted in a drastic reduction in terror threats manifesting within India over the years. The abrogation of Article 370 from Kashmir in August 2019 too has contributed to ensuring closer integration of the region with India.

Here's what's changing", "body": "The Victorian government has announced plans to increase police powers around protests in a bid to curb anti-Semitism and other forms of extremism.\n\nIt follows a suspected terror attack on a Melbourne synagogue, with the government now moving to protect religious worship in the state.\n\nAs part of the measures, police will be given greater powers when dealing with protesters, including an increased ability to search for certain items and enforce a total ban on face coverings.\n\nThe proposed legislation is yet to be finalised and must pass through parliament before becoming law.\n\nThe government will implement a mask ban at public demonstrations in Victoria.\n\nCurrently, if a protester refuses to remove their face mask, Victorian police can only ask the protester to leave the area.\n\nPolice must reasonably believe that the person is wearing the face covering primarily to conceal their identity or to protect themselves from the effects of crowd-controlling substances.\n\nThe proposed laws would give police the power to force a protester to remove their face mask or face arrest.\n\nMinister for Police Anthony Carbines said face coverings were increasingly used by people who wished to hide their identity while committing violence.\n\n\"If they're not removed, you can be arrested and charged.\"\n\nMr Carbines said exemptions would be made for legitimate health, religious or cultural reasons.\n\nPolice will also be granted greater powers to seize \"attachment devices\" -- things such as glue, rope, chains and locks used by protesters to secure themselves to the site of a protest.\n\nA number of incidents involving protesters gluing or attaching themselves to public spaces made headlines in 2024, including a climate protest atop a truck on the West Gate Bridge.\n\nIn September, a protester was arrested and charged after using concrete to secure herself to the boot of a car in the middle of a protest.\n\nUnder the proposed laws, police will be given the power to stop and search people or their vehicles if they suspect they have a dangerous attachment device, and then seize any found devices.\n\nMr Carbines said under the current law, police had to return such attachment devices to \"offenders\" if they were found.\n\n\"We know that attachment devices that people use put first responders at risk, in both removing offenders and making a situation safe, they disrupt the economy, they disrupt people from going about their lawful activities,\" he said.\n\nThe government will also move to establish \"safe access areas\" around places of religious worship such as churches, temples, mosques and synagogues.\n\nIt comes after recent protests outside synagogues in both Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nThe size of the safe zones around religious buildings is yet to be determined, with the government saying it will consult with religious leaders and communities on the matter.\n\nThe Victorian government previously established protest-free zones for the forestry industry in 2022, creating \"Timber Harvesting Safety Zones\" on worksites where any protest activity is penalised.\n\nFinally, state laws will be introduced to ban the flags and symbols of listed terrorist organisations, which the government says will fill gaps in Commonwealth anti-terror legislation.\n\nWhat is the legal community's reaction?\n\nBarrister Michael Stanton, the previous president of civil liberties organisation Liberty Victoria, said the announcement appeared to be a \"kneejerk response\".\n\nMr Stanton said the government had wrongly conflated the recent criminal act at the Adass Israel Synagogue in Ripponlea with peaceful protesting.\n\n\"There is simply no link between that and the protest movement that's been occurring for well over a year now,\" he said.\n\n\"To use that really shocking event to try to clamp down on the right to protest is deeply concerning.\"\n\nMr Stanton said the nature of protests in Melbourne's CBD, which brought them in close proximity to places such as St Paul's Cathedral, would make the government's legislation \"unworkable\".\n\n\"Banning protest outside of places of worship as a blanket rule can't be reasonable, it can't be proportionate,\" he said.\n\nDavid Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the government's plans currently lacked detail and required more scrutiny.\n\n\"There are some very real concerns in what has been announced by the premier,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of measures the premier has announced that are going to give the police wideranging and discretionary powers to target and to search anyone attending protests. This will only lead to police abuses against peaceful protesters.\"\n\nMr Mejia-Canales said the government needed to ensure any limitations on people's ability to gather peacefully needed to be \"lawful, necessary and proportionate to what they're trying to fix\".\n\n\"And we need to actually make sure that those limitations are precise and that they balance everyone's rights properly,\" he said.\n\n\"I would caution the government that rushed and kneejerk lawmaking will not make anyone safer whatsoever.\n\n\"This needs a careful, considered and consultative approach.\"\n\nWhat is the reaction from stakeholders?\n\nConvenor of protest group Students for Palestine Jasmine Duff said the proposed law reforms were an attack on the rights of protesters.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely appalling that the Victorian government is trying to limit our democratic rights to protest, to crack down on civil liberties right in the middle of a very deeply important anti-war movement,\" Ms Duff said.\n\n\"We're going to keep coming out, we're going to keep demonstrating no matter what laws are introduced by the government.\"\n\nShe said attachment devices such as glue and locks were uncommon at pro-Palestinian protests and described the ban as a political tactic.\n\nIn contrast, Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Dvir Abramovich called the reforms a \"game changer\" that would help protect the Victorian Jewish community.\n\n\"We've asked for action and the government has delivered a hammer blow to those thugs who think they can turn synagogues into war zones,\" he said.\n\n\"It's sent a message to those hiding behind masks, your days of hiding are over.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2cd156efb00442339e8058a8358599a4?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic", "eventUri": "eng-10179298", "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 35, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "2024-11-552692539", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-11-21", "time": "12:53:52", "dateTime": "2024-11-21T12:53:52Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-11-21T12:53:07Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/11/21/roots_present_crises_embracing_communist_china_us_greatest_strategic_failure__151980.html", "title": "Roots of the Present Crises: Embracing Communist China Was U.S.' Greatest Strategic Failure", "body": "From the war in Ukraine to the horrific terror attack on Oct. 7 and the subsequent conflict in the Middle East to the roiling waters of the South China Sea, the world today is in crisis. The causes are not found in Moscow or Tehran alone, but primarily in Washington and Beijing. They are the consequence of two fundamental and interrelated grand strategic mistakes made by the U.S. First, the failure to understand the threat from the People's Republic of China. Second, the failure to balance against it. As a result, the U.S. is at risk of losing its dominant position to an emboldened PRC working in cooperation with Vladimir Putin's Russia and the mullahs in Iran. Surveying the global unrest, Americans must comprehend three reasons why they face this dire strategic landscape.\n\nFirst, U.S. elites did not perceive the threat due to the triumphalism of the \"End of History\" - the false assertion that modernizing nations like China were on the path to democratization and free market economics. Great power conflict was seen as an artifact of the past. This hubris contributed to what we term \"threat deflation,\" where year after year U.S. decision-makers consistently dismissed or underestimated the threat from the PRC.\n\nSecond, U.S. business interests and financiers indefatigably sought economic gain from cooperation with Beijing. This facilitated China's rise as it entered the West's economic ecosystem, as did its admission to the World Trade Organization.\n\nTheir influence on the major U.S. political parties and at the highest levels of U.S. politics hindered the U.S. response and promoted the conceit of globalization. Thus emerged an \"engagement school,\" which asserted that by engaging the PRC, it would become wealthy, a \"responsible stakeholder\" in the international order, and even democratic. In essence, the U.S. willingly and enthusiastically taught, trained, and even equipped, its mortal enemy. Business interests and financiers funded our national security think tanks which contributed to a bias towards the engagement school, and thus to the threat deflation of the PRC.\n\nThird, Deng Xiaoping, arguably one of the greatest strategists of the 20 century, advanced a brilliant political warfare strategy to promote threat deflation. Deng's strategy focused on U.S. and other Western elites, enriching them, and shaping their perception of the PRC and of the Chinese Communist Party, while using the enticement of a growing market to influence their behavior. For a generation, Chinese leaders masked their intentions and framed their expansion as economic, for the good of all, rather than strategic and for the benefit of the CCP.\n\nConsequently, the PRC has risen and now employs its power to the detriment of U.S. national security through its worldwide actions, especially in the East and South China Seas and Taiwan, as well as through its proxies in Iran and Russia.\n\nTo meet this threat, Washington, first, needs to see Communist China for what it is: an aggressive great power which seeks the overthrow of the U.S.\n\nSecond, the U.S. must support the education of strategists so younger generations may understand how to defeat the PRC. Education in the principles of power politics and the CCP's ideology are essential to achieve victory.\n\nThird, there must be sustained presidential leadership to define the enemy, educate the American people, and generate the necessary whole of government response.\n\nFourth, the failure of the intelligence community to identify China as an existential threat greatly weakened the ability of American national security decision-makers to identify and act against the threat. The fundamental assumptions regarding China's behavior were informed by the engagement school of thought. Ultimately, and perversely, the intelligence community was aiding threat deflation for a generation. This must be reversed.\n\nFifth, U.S. military leadership did not recognize and prepare for China's emergence as a formidable military power. It must also be held accountable for the current state of unpreparedness. Specifically, the failure of the U.S. Navy's leadership to recognize the centrality of the maritime domain to the PRC's grand strategy and its naval modernization efforts stands in stark contrast to pro-active performance of prior generations of admirals from World War II through the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Leadership needs to prioritize rebuilding the U.S. Navy to meet the PRC threat.\n\nThe U.S. aided the rise of its enemy. Now the Kremlin and Iran are operating in the strategic space that the PRC provides them. That space and Beijing's aggression will only increase if the U.S. does not act to end its threat deflation, break the chokehold of the engagement school on the U.S. foreign policy establishment, and defeat the CCP by evicting it from power.", "source": {"uri": "realclearpolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Clear Politics"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/67/670455_5_.jpeg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 35, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8467263569", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-20", "time": "21:33:27", "dateTime": "2024-12-20T21:33:27Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-20T21:33:04Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/one-dead-about-70-injured-as-car-crashes-into-german-christmas-market/", "title": "One dead, about 70 injured as car crashes into German Christmas market", "body": "A car rammed into a crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday, leaving one person dead and nearly 70 others injured in what authorities suspect to be a terror attack.\n\nAccording to the UK Telegraph, the attack occurred at 7.04 pm local time in Magdeburg, the provincial capital of Saxony-Anhalt, located west of Berlin, with a population of about 240,000.\n\nEyewitnesses recounted how the vehicle smashed through barriers designed to protect the market, driving directly into unsuspecting shoppers.\n\nVideo footage from a nearby camera reportedly captured the car speeding through a narrow alleyway lined with stalls, mowing down pedestrians in its path.\n\nALSO READ: UK: DWP announces Christmas, New Year payment dates for Universal Credit, PIP, others\n\nAccording to Germany's DPA news agency, the driver of the dark-coloured BMW has been arrested, while police have cordoned off the city centre, searching for potential explosives linked to the incident.\n\nThe Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, expressed his shock, stating, \"My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.\"\n\nAuthorities have maintained a strong security presence around the suspect's car, which remains at the scene.

I mean, if he, God forbid, is convicted, it's going to frighten a lot of people and blue states into inaction,\" he said.\n\nThe problem with blue states, he warned, is an apparent double standard where politicized prosecutors pick and choose winners and losers.\n\n\"I think if you live in Oregon, Washington, California, and New York, you are kind of concerned that something like this could happen to you, especially if you're someone who thinks of themself as someone who would step up,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"In our terrorist attack, for instance... it happened on a gun-free continent. I wasn't able to carry. We had to fight this guy by hand.\"\n\nSkarlatos sees a two-tiered justice system in Democratic strongholds. Penny remained at the scene, spoke with police, and was not arrested until 11 days later when the same Manhattan District Attorney's Office that prosecuted the controversial NY v. Trump case indicted Penny on manslaughter charges.\n\n\"Hunter Biden is being pardoned today as well,\" Skarlatos said. \"There's all sorts of double standards when it comes to how blue states and Democrat leadership enforce the law.\"\n\nHe also said he believes Penny acted with others in mind, stepping in to stop an apparent threat before it got out of hand.\n\n\"If you watched his interview with police after the fact, he thought that he did the right thing and the police had Neely in custody and everything was going to be fine,\" he said.\n\nSkarlatos and two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler were on board a Paris-bound train on Aug. 21, 2015, when El Khazzani jumped out of the bathroom and opened fire.\n\nThe now-convicted terrorist had an AK-47 rifle, an automatic pistol, a box cutter, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe rifle jammed and they wrestled the guns away. By then, El Khazzani had shot one passenger, seriously slashed Mark Moogalian, an American ex-pat who was living in France and was first to engage the gunman and cut Stone multiple times.\n\n\"When we kind of got control of him and had him bent over kind of a table in the train car, he was still fighting to get away, and so I just told him, 'Stop resisting, stop resisting.' And he didn't. So I put the handgun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. And the handgun turned out to be completely empty,\" he said.\n\nSkarlatos cracked him in the head with the butt of the rifle instead, as Stone, who nearly lost his thumb, choked him out.\n\nThe former Oregon National Guard sniper said he was afraid to tell French authorities at first.\n\n\"I actually asked the American FBI, who interviewed us the next morning, if it was something that the French would have a problem with,\" he said. \"And they said, no, pretty much it's terrorism. They don't care. You can do whatever you want to terrorists in France. And so, when the French federal police interviewed me later that same day, I told them about that.\"\n\nThe three childhood friends received the French Legion of Honor, France's highest award, in 2015. Skarlatos was also given the Army's Soldier's Medal in a ceremony at the Pentagon.\n\nStone, who said later his medical training helped save the life of the fourth passenger who stepped in, Moogalian, received the Airman's Medal and Purple Heart.\n\nAll three were invited to the White House when they returned home.\n\nThey later played themselves in the Clint Eastwood-directed movie based on their memoir, \"The 15:17 to Paris\" in 2018.\n\nPenny's case has received national attention since the 26-year-old veteran's arrest on manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in May 2023.\n\nHe placed Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia and synthetic marijuana in his system, in a headlock to stop a fear-inducing outburst on a Manhattan subway car.\n\nNeely had an active arrest warrant at the time, and a history of violent attacks, and witnesses testified that they feared for their lives as Neely screamed about killing people and not being afraid to go back to jail.\n\nPenny's defense has argued that the restraint was a justified use of force and that it was not the sole factor in Neely's death. Prosecutors accuse Penny of taking the move too far.\n\nHe faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\nSkarlatos was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives last month.\n\nOnce he takes office, he said, he hopes to oppose restrictive gun control measures and ensure citizens have a chance to defend themselves.\n\n\"Word on the street is the Democrats are going to be bringing a lot of anti-gun bills, which is kind of my pet cause, so to speak, being a gun owner and surviving what we survived in France,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/daniel-penny-leaves-courtroom-judge-94734849.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "eventUri": "eng-10141450", "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 33, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "2024-12-573246090", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-11", "time": "22:14:13", "dateTime": "2024-12-11T22:14:13Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-11T22:03:52Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byk1ifdnjx", "title": "Terrorist opens fire on bus near Jerusalem, 12-year-old seriously wounded", "body": "A 12-year-old boy was seriously wounded in a shooting targeting a bus near the Tunnel Checkpoint in Jerusalem, Israel's emergency medical service, Magen David Adom, reported late on Wednesday.\n\nThe IDF confirmed the incident as a terror attack.

It's as if the text is calling out to us across the millennia: guard your spaces, protect your people. But what happens when the roofs are guarded, yet the builders themselves are unprotected? What happens when the pillars of our communities -- the rabbis, teachers, and emissaries -- are left vulnerable to threats that transcend borders?\n\nThis week, we were forced to confront those questions chillingly.\n\nRabbi Zvi Kogan was a familiar figure on the streets of Dubai. The Israeli-born Chabad emissary, who once served in the IDF and later managed a supermarket, was known for his warmth and resilience. His days were spent greeting Jewish tourists at the kosher restaurant, organizing Torah classes, and offering solace to Gulf residents navigating Jewish life far from home. He was more than a rabbi; he was the heart of a budding Jewish community.\n\nAnd now, he is missing.\n\nKogan's disappearance on Thursday sent shockwaves through the Jewish world. His car was found abandoned an hour outside Dubai, and reports suggest Iranian operatives may have been involved. The suspects have fled to Turkey. For now, we don't know where he is -- or what happened to him. But we do know this: emissaries like Kogan, the lifeblood of global Jewish communities, are increasingly in danger.\n\nThis war isn't just against Israel. It's against Jews and Jewish values. And it's happening everywhere.\n\nFrom Dubai to Amsterdam: Jews under attack\n\nKogan's disappearance comes on the heels of other chilling events. Earlier this month, in Amsterdam, Jewish fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv FC were ambushed and beaten by pro-Palestinian mobs in what can only be described as a premeditated pogrom. Videos showed men being chased into canals, slashed with knives, and spat on. \"We were ambushed,\" one fan told Maariv. Another said, \"The police abandoned us.\"\n\nIn Crown Heights, a slashing attack rattled the Chabad-centered neighborhood. And in Chicago, a Jewish man on his way to the synagogue was shot by an assailant shouting Allahu Akbar. These incidents, far from isolated, form a disturbing trend: being visibly Jewish is a risk.\n\nThe Jewish principle of pikuach nefesh -- saving a life -- has never felt more urgent. \"Whoever saves one life, it is as if they have saved the entire world\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) is not just a teaching but a rallying cry. Protecting the lives of Jewish leaders, emissaries, and communities is not optional; it is our collective obligation.\n\nStay updated with the latest news!\n\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nAs Ze'ev Jabotinsky warned, \"The Jewish people must stand guard over its safety and security. No one else will do it for us.\" His vision of Jewish self-reliance resonates as we face rising threats in an increasingly hostile world.\n\nA battle for the soul of Jewish life\n\nEmissaries like Kogan stand at the front lines of Jewish continuity. They are the keepers of tradition, the builders of community. They represent not only Jewish identity but its survival. And that makes them targets.\n\nRonald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, recently urged Nordic governments to enhance security for Jewish institutions, calling it a \"battle of values and civilizations.\" His words echo globally. If Chabad rabbis are disappearing in Dubai and Jews are being beaten in Amsterdam, where is it safe to be Jewish?\n\nIn Washington, synagogues like Kesher Israel have ramped up security ahead of the High Holidays. Rusty Rosenthal, director of security at the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, called it \"the Jewish Super Bowl\" of security preparation. Metal detectors, armed guards, and situational awareness training are now the norm. \"We don't want to lose what makes us special -- being warm and welcoming,\" one synagogue director said. But this balance is becoming harder to strike.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe disappearance of Kogan is a wake-up call. It reminds us that Jewish leaders and institutions are at the forefront of this fight, often unprotected and vulnerable. Governments must act decisively. Communities must be vigilant.

Posts on forums such as Reddit had voiced concerns over her health, particularly in regard to her weight loss, although they had not attributed it to cancer.\n\nGrande, however, has not spoken of the cancer rumors directly. In early November 2024, The New York Times published an interview with the actress and her \"Wicked\" co-star Cynthia Erivo, where they discussed contracting COVID-19 during production, but did not mention any cancer diagnosis. According to the outlet, the two performers shared:\n\nERIVO: And if there was time, we were not well. There was one time when I got Covid, there was another time when she got Covid.\n\nGRANDE: We only got sick once each, but both were before some of the most important works of the whole movie -- mine was the week before \"Popular.\" I came to set with a mask on my final days of recovery to learn the hallway finale, and no one liked this joke but I loved it so I'll tell it: We were in the dorm room together and I sang in her ear, \"Positive, you're going to be positive!\" But I wasn't positive anymore, don't worry! I took the test.\n\nERIVO: I got Covid the week before I shot \"Defying Gravity.\" It was literally like, \"Sit down, Cynthia, not yet.\"\n\nA review of Grande's public statements and social media activity revealed no mention of a cancer diagnosis. In 2023, Grande had addressed speculation about her health and diminished appearance in a video message to fans, warning against making assumptions about someone's health based on their appearance and stating that comparisons to her past physique reflected \"the unhealthiest version of [her] body.\"\n\nGrande's representatives did not respond to requests for comment about the cancer rumor. We will update you should we receive a response.\n\nIt is worth noting that Grande has participated in cancer awareness initiatives in the past. She performed at a 2014 Stand Up to Cancer telecast to raise funds in support of cancer research and treatment development, and was slated to appear at a 2018 event for the nonprofit F*** Cancer but reportedly pulled out shortly after the death of her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, from an accidental drug overdose a few weeks before the event.\n\nThe TikTok cancer rumors gained traction partly due to fans speculating on Grande's weight loss and perceived fragility during filming of \"Wicked.\" Tabloids and entertainment outlets, including Daily Mail and HELLO!, published stories about her slender frame, though none provided evidence linking her appearance to a cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"Wicked,\" directed by Jon M. Chu and co-starring Erivo, is the first of a two-part adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. Grande's role as Galinda has kept her in the public eye throughout filming, which reportedly began in late-2022. Both Grande and Erivo both faced public scrutiny over their weight loss, which fueled rumors about their health.\n\nThere is no credible evidence to support the claim that Grande was diagnosed with cancer during the filming of \"Wicked.\" The rumor likely stemmed from baseless speculation about her weight loss and health. As such, we rated this claim unfounded.\n\nSnopes has previously fact-checked rumors about Grande, including the unproven claim she offered to pay for the funerals of the Manchester bombing victims following the terror attack at Manchester Arena where she had been performing at the time.", "source": {"uri": "snopes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Snopes"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2024/11/ariana_grande_unfounded_cancer_diagnosis.png", "eventUri": "eng-10134077", "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 32, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8439219545", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-02", "time": "20:29:07", "dateTime": "2024-12-02T20:29:07Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-02T20:28:28Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "url": "https://freebeacon.com/national-security/all-hell-to-pay-trump-warns-hamas-to-return-all-hostages-by-inauguration-day-or-get-hit-harder-than-anybody-has-been-hit/", "title": "'ALL HELL TO PAY': Trump Warns Hamas To Return All Hostages by Inauguration Day or Get 'Hit Harder Than Anybody Has Been Hit'", "body": "'Everybody is talking about the hostages ... but it's all talk, and no action,' president-elect writes in Truth Social post\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has a message for Hamas and its benefactors in Tehran: Release the hostages before Inauguration Day, or else.\n\nIn a Monday afternoon Truth Social post, Trump said that \"everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World,\" but \"it's all talk, and no action!\" He went on to warn Hamas that there will be \"ALL HELL TO PAY\" if the remaining Israeli and American hostages, taken by the terror group on October 7, are not returned by the time he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,\" the president-elect went on. \"RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!\"\n\nTrump's message came just hours after Israel confirmed that an American citizen who was believed to be held hostage in Gaza, Omer Maxim Neutra, was killed by Hamas during the Oct. 7 terror attack.

Representing a coalition of national security and defense professionals, the USNDA is a non-profit organization advocating for the safe and innovative use of drones in national security, public safety, and other critical sectors.\n\nNathan Ecelbarger, spokesman for USNDA's provisional Board of Directors, commends congressional leaders, including Sen. Rick Scott and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, for championing provisions that enhance US security while bolstering the resilience of the nation's drone supply chains.\n\n\"While emerging drone technology continues to globally change the character of warfare and demonstrate critical security vulnerabilities across national security and defense spectrums, swift and coordinated actions must be taken to replace the pervasive monopoly of China's drone technology with an American drone industrial base. Simply put, regardless of security or supply chain concerns addressed in the 2025 NDAA, allowing Chinese drones flying in American skies represents an unnecessary and reversible risk.,\" Ecelbarger says.\n\nAt the core of the legislation are provisions targeting Chinese drone manufacturers like DJI and Autel Robotics. The act mandates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) list these companies and their affiliates on its Covered List within a year, unless national security agencies conclude they pose no risk.\n\nBeing placed on the Covered List would prevent these companies' drones from operating on US communications infrastructure, effectively banning new models from being imported into the country. These measures, USNDA argues, are crucial steps toward reducing dependence on foreign technology and mitigating potential security threats.\n\nRelated: DJI fires back at proposed US ban on Chinese drones\n\nThe NDAA also requires the Department of Defense (DoD) to craft a Resilient Supply Chain Strategy, specifically focused on domestic manufacturing of small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS). This strategy aims to replace China's dominance with a secure, American-led industrial base.\n\nWhile USNDA applauds the steps taken in the FY25 NDAA, Ecelbarger cautions that these measures alone are insufficient. Pointing out the lack of contingency plans for drone-related threats, Ecelbarger notes, \"After 9/11, the FAA could ground all flights nationally. No such capability exists today for drones in the event of a coordinated terror attack.\"\n\nUSNDA is urging Congress to adopt a comprehensive approach to rebuild the US drone industrial base, ensuring it not only removes reliance on Chinese technology but also accelerates the development of secure, American-made alternatives.\n\nThe organization has outlined several recommendations, including:\n\nAs drone technology becomes increasingly embedded in multiple sectors, USNDA stresses the need for urgent, coordinated action across government, industry, and academia. \"Humble, coordinated action is essential to maintaining the safety and security of our nation,\" Ecelbarger sums up.", "source": {"uri": "dronedj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DroneDJ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishveena_singh@dronedj.com", "name": "Ishveena Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/dronedj.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/usnda-united-states-national-drone-association.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-10158470", "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 31, "relevance": 1}, {"uri": "8439035987", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-12-02", "time": "17:43:26", "dateTime": "2024-12-02T17:43:26Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-12-02T17:41:57Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/12/02/white-house-on-biden-buying-anti-israel-book-he-reads-broadly/", "title": "White House on Biden Buying Anti-Israel Book: 'He Reads Broadly'", "body": "White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Air Force One en route to Angola on Monday that he could not explain why President Joe Biden had bought an anti-Israel book, except that he \"reads broadly.\"\n\nBiden was seen leaving a book store in Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Friday with his soon-to-be pardoned son, Hunter Biden, holding a book, The Hundred Years' War on Palestine, by anti-Israel author Rashid Khalidi.\n\nKhalidi recently claimed that Israel had no legal right to respond to the Hamas terror attack of October 7.
